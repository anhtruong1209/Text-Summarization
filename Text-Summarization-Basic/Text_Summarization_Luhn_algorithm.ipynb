              "'Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d\\'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (180), most goals (139) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), most international goals by a male player (115), and most international appearances by a European male (184). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 790 official senior career goals for club and country.\\n\\nBorn and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d\\'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey and four Champions Leagues, and became the club\\'s all-time top goalscorer. He also finished runner-up for the Ballon d\\'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi (his perceived career rival), and won back-to-back Ballons d\\'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana and a Coppa Italia, before returning to Manchester United in 2021.\\n\\nRonaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 180 caps, making him Portugal\\'s most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the nation\\'s all-time top goalscorer. He has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\\n\\nOne of the world\\'s most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world\\'s most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.[8]\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[11] His great-grandmother on his father\\'s side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia \"Katia\".[13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father\\'s alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[14] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[15]\\n\\nAs a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[11] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting\\'s youth academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[18] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him.[18] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[19] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[20] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[21]\\n\\nAt age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting\\'s youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club\\'s under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal\\'s grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[25]\\n\\nManchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[26] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[26] for what he considered to be \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen.[27] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[28]\\n\\nRonaldo\\'s move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[30] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[31] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[32] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He\\'s been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\"[34]\\n\\nRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[35] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen.[29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[36] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[37] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[38] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United\\'s 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[39] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[40] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[41] but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[42]\\n\\nRonaldo scored United\\'s 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[43] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[44] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[45][46] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4.[47] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United\\'s 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[48]\\n\\nDuring his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans,[49] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City\\'s former United player Andy Cole.[50] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger\\'s showboating style of play.[51] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[52] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[53] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[54]\\n\\nAlthough his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[55] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[56] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[57][58][59] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[60]\\n\\nAt the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[61] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.[62] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[63] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[64] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[65] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years.[66] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers\\' Association\\'s Player\\'s Player, Fans\\' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers\\' Association\\'s Footballer of the Year award,[67][68] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[69] His wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension.[70] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or,[71] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[72]\\n\\nRonaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[73] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[74] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best\\'s total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club\\'s new single-season record by a midfielder.[75] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[76] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[77] He additionally received the PFA Players\\' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[78][79] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon, which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate,[80] and, while playing as a striker, scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma.[81] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[82] United emerged victorious.[83] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[84]\\n\\nRonaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[85] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo\\'s interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid\\'s alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[86] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \"modern slavery\".[87] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[88] he remained at United for another year.[89]\\n\\nAhead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[90] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[91] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[92] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[93] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[94] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[95] With his 2008 Ballon d\\'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United\\'s first Ballon d\\'Or winner since Best in 1968,[96] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[97]\\n\\nHis match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[98] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[99] United advanced to the final in Rome,[100] where he made little impact in United\\'s 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[101] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[102][103] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[104] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[105]\\n\\nAhead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).[106] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[107] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[108] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[109] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[110]\\n\\nRonaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid\\'s 3–2 home win.[111] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[112] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[113] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[114][115] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[116] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d\\'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi of Barcelona, Madrid\\'s rivals. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga.[117][118] His first season at Madrid ended trophyless.[119]\\n\\nFollowing Raúl\\'s departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[120] His subsequent return to his Ballon d\\'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[121] His haul concluded a run of scoring in six consecutive matches for club and country, totalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and Málaga.[122][123][124] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or.[125] During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[126][127] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[128] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[129]\\n\\nDuring the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[130] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season\\'s midway point.[131][132][133] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[134] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[135] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[136] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[137] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[138]\\n\\nRonaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[139] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \"professional issue\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[140] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[141] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[142] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[143]\\n\\nFollowing the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring a brace to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[144] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[145] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[146] He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[147] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[148] a club record.[139] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 defeat to Atlético, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[149] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu,[150] he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[151] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[152] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid\\'s only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg.[153]\\n\\nAt the start of the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.[154] He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior.[155] Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \"BBC\", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).[156] By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland and Sweden.[157][158][159] He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally.[160] He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[161]\\n\\nConcurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[162] After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[163] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[164] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\".[165] As the competition\\'s top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[166] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[167]\\n\\nIn the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón,[168] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[169] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[170] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.[171] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[172] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[173] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[174]\\n\\nDuring the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid\\'s 2–0 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[175] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds.[176] His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches.[176][177] After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[178] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d\\'Or,[179] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[180] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[181] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04.[182] He scored both of his side\\'s goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.[183] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[184] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[185] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[186] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano\\'s club record of 28.[175] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[175]\\n\\nAt the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club\\'s all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club\\'s previous recordholder, Raúl.[187] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[189] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[190] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition\\'s group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö.[191]\\n\\nRonaldo\\'s four goals in a 7–1 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition\\'s second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[192] He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals.[193] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[194] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atlético, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid\\'s 11th victory.[195] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.[195] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[196]\\n\\nRonaldo missed Madrid\\'s first three matches of the 2016–17 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final.[197] On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that \"they made me who I am.\"[198] On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021.[199] On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 away win against Atlético, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals.[200] On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 win over Club América in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[201] He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.[202] Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament.[203] He won the 2016 Ballon d\\'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.[204]\\n\\nIn the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[205] In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a \\'perfect\\' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4–2 after extra-time.[206] On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atlético 3–0 in the Champions League semi-final first leg.

With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus\\'s history to reach that milestone in a season.[255][256] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[257] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria, which saw Juventus crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[258] He finished his second league campaign with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals.[259][260] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel\\'s club record of 36 goals in a single season.[261] Despite the win, the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[262]\\n\\nOn 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus\\'s opening league match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Sampdoria.[263] On 1 November, after Ronaldo took nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4–1 away win.[264] On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match to reach his 750th senior career goal.[265] Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79.[266] On 20 January 2021, Juventus won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana after a 2–0 win against Napoli, with Ronaldo scoring the opening goal.[267] On 2 March, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe.[268] On 9 March, Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 by Porto, again on the away goals rule (4–4 on aggregate).[269] On 14 March, he scored his 57th career hat-trick in a 3–1 away win over Cagliari.[270] On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[271] With Juventus\\'s victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[272] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[273]\\n\\nOn 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for Álvaro Morata in the 2–2 against Udinese Calcio.[274] Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo\\'s fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[275] and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had \"no intention\" of remaining a Juventus player.[276] On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[277] but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.[278] On the same day, it was confirmed that City\\'s rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo\\'s former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[279][280] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[281][282]\\n\\nOn 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[283] The transfer was reported as costing an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[284] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[285] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo\\'s shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[286]\\n\\nOn 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[287] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United\\'s 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League. The match also saw Ronaldo overtake Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[288]\\n\\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[6]\\n\\nAged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,[289] coming on as a half-time subtitute for Luís Figo.[290] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[290] After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[291] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.[292] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[293]\\n\\nRonaldo was Portugal\\'s second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[289] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal\\'s second match of the group stage.[294] aged 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[295] In Portugal\\'s an infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[290] Following Portugal\\'s 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[296] In Portugal\\'s quarter-final against England, Ronaldo\\'s Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney\\'s infraction,[297] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal\\'s bench following Rooney\\'s dismissal.[290][298] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[290] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[299] FIFA\\'s Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament\\'s Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany\\'s Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[290][300] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[301][302]\\n\\nOne day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[303] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[304] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[305] While he scored eight goals in the qualification,[306] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic; in the same game, he also set-up Portugal\\'s third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.[307][308] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[309]\\n\\nAfter Portugal\\'s unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[310] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad\\'s permanent captain in July 2008.[311] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,[290] as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[312] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[313][314][315] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[316] Portugal\\'s World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[317]\\n\\nRonaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a \"group of death\".[318] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win.[319] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win.[320] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[321][322] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar,[323] Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot,[324] a decision that was questioned by the media.[325][326][327] Ronaldo\\'s own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo \"demanded\" to take the last penalty.[328] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[329]\\n\\nDuring the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[330] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[331] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team\\'s goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović, which ensured their place at the tournament.[332] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equaling Pauleta\\'s record.[333] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country\\'s all-time top scorer.[334]\\n\\nRonaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[335][336] potentially risking his career.[337] Ronaldo later commented: \"If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don\\'t.\"[338] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[339] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.[340] After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[341] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[342] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[343] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[342]\\n\\nRonaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[344] With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition\\'s all-time leading goalscorer.[345] At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal\\'s draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal\\'s most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[346] With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[347][348] Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition\\'s newly expanded format,[349] despite not winning any of their games.[290]\\n\\nIn Portugal\\'s first knockout match, Ronaldo\\'s only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia\\'s goalkeeper Danijel Subašić into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time.[290] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal\\'s opening penalty,[290] he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[350] he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition\\'s all-time top scorer with nine goals.[351] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on,[290] he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory.[352] As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country\\'s first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[353][354]\\n\\nFollowing the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Estádio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.[355]\\n\\nIn Portugal\\'s opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma\\'s opening goal in a 2–2 draw.[356] Three days later, he scored in a 1–0 win over hosts Russia.[357] On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4–0 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled Sándor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all-time, behind only Ferenc Puskás.[358][359] He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal\\'s group stage matches.[360] Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3–0 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children,[361] and missed Portugal\\'s third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2–1 after extra time.[362]\\n\\nOn 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pelé and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals.[363] These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatović\\'s record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo\\'s hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.[364] Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2–0 win.[365]\\n\\nOn 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3–3 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so.[366] On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás\\' record as the highest European goalscorer of all-time, with 85 international goals.[367] In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain.[368] On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2–1 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16.[369] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[370]\\n\\nAfter the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana\\'s Asamoah Gyan.[371] In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0.[372]\\n\\nOn 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5–1 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match;[373] in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals.[374] He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40,[375] while also completing his eighth international hat-trick.[376] On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2–1 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier.[377] On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2–0 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020.[378] On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2–0 away win over Sweden in a 2020–21 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe.[379][380] On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic.[381] By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.[382]\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal\\'s first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in Budapest.[383] This took him to a total of eleven European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition\\'s history.[384] He also became the first player to score at five European Championships,[385] and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the European Championship,[386] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[387] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal\\'s 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei\\'s record of 109 international goals.[388] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[389] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[390]\\n\\nOn 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2–1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at Algarve Stadium, which saw him pass Daei\\'s international record of 109 goals to become the sole record holder.[391] On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at Algarve Stadium; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos\\'s record for the most international caps received by a European player.[392] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men\\'s international football.[393]\\n\\nA versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[394] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[395] He ranks among the world\\'s fastest footballers, both with and without the ball.[396] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[396][397] such as the step overs and so-called \\'chops\\' that became his trademark;[398] he has also been known to use the flip–flap.[399]\\n\\nAs Ronaldo matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that allowed him to retain possession of the ball under pressure, and strong legs that enabled an outstanding jumping ability.[401] His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[402][403][404] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[396][402]\\n\\nIn his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[402] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[402][405] An accurate penalty kick taker,[406] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[407] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[408] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[409] Regarding Ronaldo\\'s unique style of taking free kicks, former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying \\'All eyes on me\\' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\"[410]\\n\\nAt Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[412] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[412][413][414] Madrid\\'s counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[415][416][417] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[413][418] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[412][419][420] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[421][422][423]\\n\\nIn his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates\\' crosses.[424][425] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[426][427][428] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[425]\\n\\nRonaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi.[note 5] Winning his first Ballon d\\'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[430] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[431] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[432] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[note 6]\\n\\nRonaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[433][434] On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo\\'s focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\"[411] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano\\'s approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\"[435] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring.[436] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[437] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[note 7] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[438] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[439]\\n\\nDuring his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \"arrogant image\" on the pitch,[440] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \"victim\" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[441] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[440] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[441] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[442][443][444]\\n\\nRonaldo has adopted several goalscoring celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[445][446][447] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\"[446] into his \"signature power stance\",[447] while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"Sí\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\").[445][448] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \"Sii!\" in the media.[445][446][449]\\n\\nBoth players have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[450] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[451][452] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two,[453] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[454][455][456]\\n\\nIn a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.\"[458] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo\\'s manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \"I don\\'t think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\"[459] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I\\'ve never fought with Cristiano.\"[460] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don\\'t have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don\\'t with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it\\'s a good thing.\"[457] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world\\'s biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world\\'s most viewed annual sporting events.[461]\\n\\nIn a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter\\'s \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[462] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it\\'s good to be part of the history of football.\"[463]\\n\\nAs his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots—since November 2012 Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalized CR7 edition,[464] soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics and video games.[465][466][467][468] Ronaldo was featured as the cover star of EA Sports\\' FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game\\'s promotion.[469] His \\'Siiii\\' goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover.[445] He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.[470]\\n\\nWith earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of The Highest-Paid Athletes Of The Decade, with only boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. earning more.[471] Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world\\'s highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15.[472][473] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine\\'s list of The World\\'s Highest-Paid Athletes.[474] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[475] He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17.[476] He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.[477] Ronaldo is one of the world\\'s most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012[478] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[478][479] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[480] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time\\'s annual list of the most influential people in the world.[481] ESPN named Ronaldo the world\\'s most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.[482][483][484][485]\\n\\nRonaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers.[487] The most-followed person on Facebook (148 million), the most-followed on Instagram (310 million) and the most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (92 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 to June 2017.[476] Ronaldo has released two mobile apps. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[488] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.[489] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo\\'s name first on the list.[490]\\n\\nRonaldo has been the subject of several works. His autobiography, titled Moments, was published in December 2007.[491] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was consequently subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film\\'s release in September 2011.[492] Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[493] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.[494][495]\\n\\nDemand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo\\'s number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product.[496] In 2015, Ronaldo\\'s number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi\\'s number 10 Barcelona shirt.[497] In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.[498]\\n\\nRonaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008.[499] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013.[500] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014.[501][502] In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, \"Legacy\", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.[503]\\n\\nIn 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus).[504] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia;[505] the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira.[506][507] At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry \"to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.\"[508] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.[509]\\n\\nIn June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer – after Steven Gerrard, Pelé and David Beckham – to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London.[510] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013.[511] In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.[512]\\n\\nOn 23 July 2016, following Portugal\\'s triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[513] The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[514] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust\\'s likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[515] while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[516][514] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust;[517] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[518]\\n\\nRonaldo has four children. He first became a father to a son, Cristiano Jr., born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[519] He stated that he has full custody of the child and would not be publicly revealing the identity of the mother per agreement with her.[520][521] In January 2015, Ronaldo announced his five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk had ended.[522]\\n\\nRonaldo then became father to twins, daughter Eva and son Mateo, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy.[523] He is in a relationship with Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez, a former shop assistant,[524] who gave birth to their daughter Alana Martina, on 12 November 2017.[525]\\n\\nRonaldo\\'s father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[526][527] Ronaldo said that he does not drink alcohol,[528] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[529] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[530] His mother Dolores was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 but eventually recovered.[531]\\n\\nRonaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[532][533] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[534] In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother\\'s life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[535] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.[536]\\n\\nIn 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[537] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA\\'s \"11 for Health\" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria and obesity.[538] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children\\'s new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[539] In March, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[540]\\n\\nRonaldo was named the world\\'s most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[541] In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the Champions League.[541] In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.[542]\\n\\nIn July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[543] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[544]\\n\\nRonaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[545]\\n\\nIn April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[546][547] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo\\'s lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[546][548] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an \"intentional defamation campaign\" with parts significantly \"altered and/or completely fabricated\",[549][550] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[551] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: \"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"[552] The Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman is seeking £56 million in damages from Ronaldo in a civil lawsuit.[553]\\n• Medal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa (Portuguese Royal Family)[568]\\n• Grand officer of the Order of Prince Henry[1]\\n• Commander of the Order of Merit[569]\\n• List of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\\n• List of men\\'s footballers with 100 or more international caps\\n• List of men\\'s footballers with 50 or more international goals\\n• List of men\\'s footballers with the most official appearances\\n• List of men\\'s footballers with 500 or more goals\\n• None Caioli, Luca (2016) [2012].

              "  Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team. <mark>Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player.</mark> He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (180), most goals (139) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), most international goals by a male player (115), and most international appearances by a European male (184). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 790 official senior career goals for club and country. <mark>Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season.</mark> <mark>He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or.</mark> <mark>Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer.</mark> He also finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi (his perceived career rival), and won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana and a Coppa Italia, before returning to Manchester United in 2021. <mark>Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 180 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player.</mark> With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the nation's all-time top goalscorer. He has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. <mark>He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.</mark> One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career. [8]\n",
              "\n",
              "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António. [9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man. [11] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde. [12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia \"Katia\". [13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure. [14] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings. [15]\n",
              "\n",
              "As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[11] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500. [17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy. [17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football. [18] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him. [18] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. [19] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. [20] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later. [21]\n",
              "\n",
              "At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling. [22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season. <mark>[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.</mark> [23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. [24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer. [25]\n",
              "\n",
              "Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. [26] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[26] for what he considered to be \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen. [27] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member. <mark>[28]\n",
              "\n",
              "Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.</mark> [30] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history. [31] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. [32] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. [33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career. <mark>\"[34]\n",
              "\n",
              "Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.</mark> [35] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen. [29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. <mark>[36] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[37] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.</mark> <mark>[38] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.</mark> [39] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final. [40] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[41] but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player. [42]\n",
              "\n",
              "Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough. [43] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. [44] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal. [45][46] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4. <mark>[47] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.</mark> [48]\n",
              "\n",
              "During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans,[49] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole. [50] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. [51] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[52] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. [53] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club. [54]\n",
              "\n",
              "Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[55] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. [56] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading. [57][58][59] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours. <mark>[60]\n",
              "\n",
              "At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[61] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.</mark> [62] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[63] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro. [64] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat. <mark>[65] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years.</mark> [66] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[67][68] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. [69] His wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension. [70] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[71] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award. [72]\n",
              "\n",
              "Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table. [73] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.

While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations.

[409] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in.

              "At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. [412] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. [412][413][414] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. [415][416][417] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank. [413][418] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. [412][419][420] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities. [421][422][423]\n",

              "In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. [424][425] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation. [426][427][428] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri. [425]\n",

[note 5] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history. [430] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[431] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[432] especially in important and high-pressured situations.

              "Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. [433][434] On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game. \"[411] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it. \"[435] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring. [436] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s. [437] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled. [note 7] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player. [438] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.

[441] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[440] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.

[445][446][447] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a \"storming jump\" and \"turn\", before \"landing in spread-eagled fashion\"[446] into his \"signature power stance\",[447] while usually simultaneously exclaiming \"Sí\" (Spanish and Italian for \"yes\").

Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game. [450] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing. [451][452] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two,[453] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character. [454][455][456]\n",

              "In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: \"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high. \"[458] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: \"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best. \"[459] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano. \"[460] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing. \"[457] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.

In response to Blatter's \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla. [462] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well.

For executing the effort, “The devil is in the details,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The Army is working with CMU and private companies on a prototype platform, including with\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://visimo.ai/\"><span>Visimo</span></a><span>\\xa0of Coraopolis, Pa., which offers AI development services. Faber said he prefers to collaborate and coordinate with private industry rather than buying products off the shelf. “The problem with that is, you are stuck with the value you are being provided by that one vendor, which is usually not designed for the challenges of DOD networks,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Army Trains a Range of Tech Teams in AI</span></b><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The Army engages in AI workforce development efforts for several teams, including:\\xa0 leadership, professionals with graduate degrees; technical staff, which is put through training to get certified; and AI users.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Tech teams in the Army have different areas of focus include: general purpose software development, operational data science, deployment which includes analytics, and a machine learning operations team, such as a large team required to build a computer vision system. “As folks come through the workforce, they need a place to collaborate, build and share,” Faber said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Types of projects include diagnostic, which might be combining streams of historical data, predictive and prescriptive, which recommends a course of action based on a prediction. “At the far end is AI; you don’t start with that,” said Faber. The developer has to solve three problems: data engineering, the AI development platform, which he called “the green bubble,” and the deployment platform, which he called “the red bubble.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“These are mutually exclusive and all interconnected. Those teams of different people need to programmatically coordinate. Usually a good project team will have people from each of those bubble areas,” he said. “If you have not done this yet, do not try to solve the green bubble problem. It makes no sense to pursue AI until you have an operational need.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Asked by a participant which group is the most difficult to reach and train, Faber said without hesitation, “The hardest to reach are the executives. They need to learn what the value is to be provided by the AI ecosystem. The biggest challenge is how to communicate that value,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Panel Discusses AI Use Cases with the Most Potential</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In a panel on Foundations of Emerging AI, moderator Curt Savoie, program director, Global Smart Cities Strategies for IDC, the market research firm, asked what emerging AI use case has the most potential.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Jean-Charles Lede, autonomy tech advisor for the US Air Force, Office of Scientific Research, said,” I would point to decision advantages at the edge, supporting pilots and operators, and decisions at the back, for mission and resource planning.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21161\" style=\"width: 215px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21161\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-29KristaKinnard-2.jpeg\" width=\"215\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21161\">Krista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>Krista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor, said, “Natural language processing is an opportunity to open the doors to AI in the Department of Labor,” she said. “Ultimately, we are dealing with data on people, programs,\\xa0and organizations.”\\xa0\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Savoie asked what are the big risks and dangers the panelists see when implementing AI.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the General Services Administration (GSA), said in a typical IT organization using traditional software development, the impact of a decision by a developer only goes so far. With AI, “You have to consider the impact on a whole class of people, constituents,\\xa0and stakeholders. With a simple change in algorithms, you could be delaying benefits to millions of people or making incorrect inferences at scale. That’s the most important risk,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>He said he asks his contract partners to have “humans in the loop and humans on the loop.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Kinnard seconded this, saying, “We have no intention of removing humans from the loop. It’s really about empowering people to make better decisions.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>She emphasized the importance of monitoring the AI models after they are deployed. “Models can drift as the data underlying the changes,” she said. “So you need a level of critical thinking to not only do the task, but to assess whether what the AI model is doing is acceptable.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>She added, “We have built out use cases and partnerships across the government to make sure we’re implementing responsible AI. We will never replace people with algorithms.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lede of the Air Force said, “We often have use cases where the data does not exist. We cannot explore 50 years of war data, so we use simulation. The risk is in teaching an algorithm that you have a ‘simulation to real gap’ that is a real risk. You are not sure how the algorithms will map to the real world.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Chaudhry emphasized the importance of a testing strategy for AI systems. He warned of developers “who get enamored with a tool and forget the purpose of the exercise.” He recommended the development manager design in independent verification and validation strategy. “Your testing, that is where you have to focus your energy as a leader. The leader needs an idea in mind, before committing resources, on how they will justify whether the investment was a success.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lede of the Air Force talked about the importance of\\xa0explainability. “I am a technologist. I don’t\\xa0do laws. The ability for the AI function to explain in a way a human can interact with, is important. The AI is a partner that we have a dialogue with, instead of the AI coming up with a conclusion that we have no way of verifying,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Learn more at\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government.</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

With an emphasis on applied AI and data science, she oversees risk mitigation policies and standards and has been involved with applying AI to save lives, fight fraud, and strengthen the cybersecurity infrastructure.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>She emphasized the need for the AI project effort to be part of a strategic portfolio. “My office is there to drive a holistic view on AI and to mitigate risk by bringing us together to address challenges,” she said. The effort is assisted by the DOE’s AI and Technology Office, which is focused on transforming the DOE into a world-leading AI enterprise by accelerating research, development, delivery and the adoption of AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“I am telling my organization to be mindful of the fact that you can have tons and tons of data, but it might not be representative,” she said. Her team looks at examples from international partners, industry, academia and other agencies for outcomes “we can trust” from systems incorporating AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“We know that AI is disruptive, in trying to do what humans do and do it better,” she said. “It is beyond human capability; it goes beyond data in spreadsheets; it can tell me what I’m going to do next before I contemplate it myself. It’s that powerful,” she said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As a result, close attention must be paid to data sources. “AI is vital to the economy and our national security. We need precision; we need algorithms we can trust; we need accuracy. We don’t need biases,” Isom said, adding, “And don’t forget that you need to monitor the output of the models long after they have been deployed.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Executive Orders Guide GSA AI Work</span></b><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Executive Order 14028, a detailed set of actions to address the cybersecurity of government agencies, issued in May of this year, and Executive Order 13960, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the Federal government, issued in December 2020, provide valuable guides to her work.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To help manage the risk of AI development and deployment, Isom has produced the AI Risk Management Playbook, which provides guidance around system features and mitigation techniques. It also has a filter for ethical and trustworthy principles which are considered throughout AI lifecycle stages and risk types. Plus, the playbook ties to relevant Executive Orders.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>And it provides examples, such as your results came in at 80%\\xa0accuracy, but you wanted 90%. “Something is wrong there,” Isom said, adding, “The playbook helps you look at these types of problems and what you can do to mitigate risk, and what factors you should weigh as you design and build your project.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>While internal to DOE at present, the agency is looking into next steps for an external version. “We will share it with other federal agencies soon,” she said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>GSA Best Practices for Scaling AI Projects Outlined</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21167\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21167\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-29AnilChaudhry-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21167\">Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations, AI Center of Excellence (CoE), GSA</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the AI Center of Excellence (CoE) of the GSA, who spoke on Best Practices for Implementing AI at Scale, has over 20 years of experience in technology delivery, operations and program management in the defense, intelligence and national security sectors.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The mission of the\\xa0CoE\\xa0is to accelerate technology modernization across the government, improve the public experience and increase operational efficiency. “Our business model is to partner with industry subject matter experts to solve problems,” Chaudhry said, adding, “We are not in the business of recreating industry solutions and duplicating them.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The\\xa0CoE\\xa0is providing recommendations to partner agencies and working with them to implement AI systems as the federal government engages heavily in AI development. “For AI, the government landscape is vast. Every federal agency has some sort of AI project going on right now,” he said, and the maturity of AI experience varies widely across agencies.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Typical use cases he is seeing include having AI focus on increasing speed and efficiency, on cost savings and cost avoidance, on improved response time and increased quality and compliance. As one best practice, he recommended the agencies\\xa0</span><b><span>vet their commercial experience\\xa0</span></b><span>with the large datasets they will encounter in government.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“We’re talking petabytes and exabytes here, of structured and unstructured data,” Chaudhry said.\\xa0</span><i><span>[Ed.

Sonderling is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit discrimination against job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or\\xa0disability.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“The thought that AI would become mainstream in HR departments was closer to science fiction two year ago, but the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which AI is being used by employers,” he said. “Virtual recruiting is now here to stay.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It’s a busy time for HR professionals. “The great resignation is leading to the great rehiring, and AI will play a role in that like we have not seen before,” Sonderling said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>AI has been employed for years in hiring—“It did not happen overnight.”—for tasks including chatting with applications, predicting whether a candidate would take the job, projecting what type of employee they would be and mapping out upskilling and reskilling opportunities. “In short, AI is now making all the decisions once made by HR personnel,” which he did not characterize as good or bad.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Carefully designed and properly used, AI has the potential to make the workplace more fair,” Sonderling said. “But carelessly implemented, AI could discriminate on a scale we have never seen before by an HR professional.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Training Datasets for AI Models Used for Hiring Need to Reflect Diversity</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This is because AI models rely on training data. If the company’s current workforce is used as the basis for training, “It will replicate the status quo. If it’s one gender or one race primarily, it will replicate that,” he said. Conversely, AI can help mitigate risks of hiring bias by race, ethnic background, or disability status. “I want to see AI improve on workplace discrimination,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Amazon began building a hiring application in 2014, and found over time that it discriminated against women in its recommendations, because the AI model was trained on a dataset of the company’s own hiring record for the previous 10 years, which was primarily of males. Amazon developers tried to correct it but ultimately scrapped the system in 2017.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Facebook has recently agreed to pay $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the US government that the social media company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules, according to an account from\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/facebook-pay-up-1425-mln-settle-us-employment-discrimination-claims-2021-10-19/\"><span>Reuters</span></a><span>. The case centered on Facebook’s use of what it called its PERM program for labor certification. The government found that Facebook refused to hire American workers for jobs that had been reserved for temporary visa holders under the PERM program.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Excluding people from the hiring pool is a violation,” Sonderling said.\\xa0 If the AI program “withholds the existence of the job opportunity to that\\xa0class, so\\xa0they cannot exercise their rights, or if it downgrades a protected class, it is within our domain,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Employment assessments, which became more common after World War II, have provided\\xa0 high value to HR managers and with help from AI they have the potential to minimize bias in hiring. “At the same time, they are vulnerable to claims of discrimination, so\\xa0employers\\xa0need to be careful and cannot take a hands-off approach,” Sonderling said. “Inaccurate data will amplify bias in decision-making. Employers must be vigilant against discriminatory outcomes.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>He recommended researching solutions from vendors who vet data for risks of bias on the basis of race, sex, and other factors.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One example is from\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.hirevue.com/\"><span>HireVue\\xa0</span></a><span>of South Jordan, Utah, which has\\xa0built a\\xa0hiring platform predicated on the US Equal Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, designed specifically to mitigate unfair hiring practices, according to an account from\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://allwork.space/2021/10/ai-streamlines-the-hiring-process-for-many-companies-but-is-that-a-good-thing/\"><span>allWork</span></a><span>.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A post on AI ethical principles on its website states in part, “Because\\xa0HireVue\\xa0uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or\\xa0propagation\\xa0of bias against any group or individual. We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible.

We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Also, “Our data scientists and IO psychologists build\\xa0HireVue\\xa0Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment’s predictive accuracy.

Because algorithms are often trained on single-origin data samples with limited diversity, when applied in real-world scenarios to a broader population of different races, genders, ages, and more, tech that appeared highly accurate in research may prove unreliable.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Also, “There needs to be an element of governance and peer review for all algorithms, as even the most solid and tested algorithm is bound to have unexpected results arise. An algorithm is never done learning</span><span>—</span><span>it must be constantly developed and fed more data to improve.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>And, “As an industry, we need to become more skeptical of AI&#8217;s conclusions and encourage transparency in the industry.

The rapid response team conducts bedside evaluation of the patient and calibrates the course treatment with the hospitalist.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In advice to other practitioners, Daniels recommended a focus on how the tool will be fit into the workflow of health care teams. “It took us about five years to perform the initial mapping of the electronic medical record backend and develop the predictive models,” Daniels stated. “It then took us another two to three years to transition these models into a live web services application that could be used operationally.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In an example from the food industry, a PepsiCo Frito-Lay plant in Fayetteville, Tenn. is using predictive maintenance successfully, with year-to-date equipment downtime at 0.75%\\xa0and unplanned downtime at 2.88%, according to Carlos Calloway, the site’s reliability engineering manager, in an account in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.plantservices.com/articles/2021/push-the-needle-how-6-companies-are-achieving-predictive-maintenance-success/\"><span>PlantServices</span></a><span>.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Examples of monitoring include: vibration readings confirmed by ultrasound helped to prevent a PC combustion blower motor from failing and shutting down the whole potato chip department; infrared analysis of the main pole for the plant’s GES automated warehouse detected a hot fuse holder, which helped to avoid a shutdown of the entire warehouse; and increased acid levels were detected in oil samples from a baked extruder gearbox, indicating oil degradation, which enabled prevention of a shutdown of Cheetos Puffs production.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The Frito-Lay plant produces more than 150 million pounds of product per year, including Lays, Ruffles, Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos, and Tostitos.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The types of monitoring include vibration analysis, used on mechanical applications, which is processed with the help of a third-party company which sends alerts to the plant for investigation and resolution.\\xa0Another service partner performs quarterly vibration monitoring on selected equipment. All motor control center rooms and electrical panels are monitored with quarterly infrared analysis, which is also used on electrical equipment, some rotating equipment, and heat exchangers. In addition, the plant has done ultrasonic monitoring for more than 15 years, and it is “kind of like the pride and joy of our site from a predictive standpoint,” stated Calloway.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The plan has a number of products in place from UE Systems of Elmsford, NY, supplier of ultrasonic instruments, hardware and software, and training for predictive maintenance.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Louisiana Alumina Plant Automating Bearing Maintenance\\xa0</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Bearings, which wear over time under varying conditions of weather and temperature in the case of automobiles, are a leading candidate for IoT monitoring and predictive maintenance with AI. The\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://www.newdayal.com/noranda-alumina\"><span>Noranda Alumina</span></a><span>\\xa0plant in Gramercy, La. is finding a big payoff from its investment in a system to improve the lubrication of bearings in its production equipment.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The system has resulted in a 60%\\xa0decline in bearing changes in the second year of using the new lubrication system, translating to some $900,000 in savings on bearings that did not need to be replaced and avoided downtime.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Four hours of downtime is about $1 million dollars’ worth of lost production,” stated Russell Goodwin, a reliability engineer and millwright instructor at Noranda Alumina, in the\\xa0PlantServices\\xa0account, which was based on presentations at the Leading Reliability 2021 event.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The Noranda Alumina plant is the only alumina plant operating in the US.\\xa0“If we shut down, you’ll need to import it,” stated Goodwin. The plant experiences pervasive dust, dirt, and caustic substances, which complicate efforts at improved reliability and maintenance practices.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Noranda Alumina tracks all motors and gearboxes at 1,500 rpm and higher with vibration readings, and most below 1,500 with ultrasound. Ultrasonic monitoring, of sound in ranges beyond human hearing, was introduced to the plant after Goodwin joined the company in 2019. At the time, grease monitoring had room for improvement. “If grease was not visibly coming out of the seal, the mechanical supervisor did not count the round as complete,” stated Goodwin.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>After introducing automation, the greasing system has improved dramatically, he stated. The system was also able to detect bearings in a belt whose bearings were wearing out too quickly due to contamination. “Tool-enabled tracking helped to prove that it wasn’t improper greasing, but rather the bearing was made improperly,” stated Goodwin.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Read the source articles and information in\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://iot-analytics.com/predictive-maintenance-market-evolution-from-niche-topic-to-high-roi-application/\"><span>IoT Analytics</span></a><span>,\\xa0</span><span>in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3624014/predictive-analytics-4-success-stories.html?upd=1635362935537\"><span>CIO</span></a><span>\\xa0and in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.plantservices.com/articles/2021/push-the-needle-how-6-companies-are-achieving-predictive-maintenance-success/\"><span>PlantServices</span></a><span>.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

Was it a mistake, or did it fit within the parameters of what the AI was expected to produce? There is also the immediate consideration of whether the AI somehow is slipping toward the precipice of becoming sentient.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Please be aware that no AI system in existence is anywhere close to reaching sentience, despite the\\xa0claims and falsehoods tossed around in the media. As such, if today’s AI seems to do something that appears to be a novel act, you should not leap to the conclusion that this is a sign of human insight within technology or the emergence of human ingenuity among AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That’s an anthropomorphic bridge too far.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The reality is that any such AI “insightful” novelties are based on various concrete computational algorithms and tangible data-based pattern matching.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In today’s column, we’ll be taking a close look at an example of an AI-powered novel act, illustrated via the game of Go, and relate these facets to the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars as a means of understanding the AI-versus-human related ramifications.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Realize that the capacity to spot or suggest a novelty is being done methodically by an AI system, while, in contrast, no one can say for sure how humans can devise novel thoughts or intuitions.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Perhaps we too are bound by some internal mechanistic-like facets, or maybe there is something else going on. Someday, hopefully, we will crack open the secret inner workings of the mind and finally know how we think. I suppose it might undercut the mystery and magical aura that oftentimes goes along with those of us that have moments of outside-the-box visions, though I’d trade that enigma to know how the cups-and-balls trickery truly functions (going behind the curtain, as it were).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Speaking of novelty, a famous game match involving the playing of Go can provide useful illumination on this overall topic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Go is a popular board game\\xa0in the same complexity category as chess. Arguments are made about which is tougher, chess or Go, but I’m not going to get mired into that morass. For the sake of civil discussion, the key point is that Go is highly complex and requires intense mental concentration especially\\xa0at the\\xa0tournament level.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Generally, Go consists of trying to capture territory on a standard Go board, consisting of a 19 by 19 grid of intersecting lines. For those of you that have never tried playing Go, the closest similar kind of game might be the connect-the-dots that you played in childhood, which involves grabbing up territory, though Go is magnitudes more involved.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is no need for you to know anything in particular about Go to get the gist of what will be discussed next regarding the act of human novelty and the act of AI novelty.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A famous Go competition took place about four years ago that pitted one of the world’s top professional Go players, Lee Sedol, against an AI program that had been crafted to play Go, coined as AlphaGo. There is a riveting documentary about the contest and plenty of write-ups and online videos that have in detail covered the match, including post-game analysis.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Put yourself back in time to 2016 and relive what happened.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Most AI developers did not anticipate that the AI of that time would be proficient enough to beat a top Go player. Sure, AI had already been able to best some top chess players, and thus offered a glimmer of expectation that Go would eventually be equally undertaken, but there weren’t any Go programs that had been able to compete at the pinnacle levels of human Go players. Most expected that it would probably be around the year 2020 or so before the capabilities of AI would be sufficient to compete in world-class Go tournaments.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>DeepMind Created AlphaGo Using Deep Learning, Machine Learning</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A small-sized tech company named DeepMind Technologies devised the AlphaGo AI playing system (the firm was later acquired by Google). Using techniques from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the AlphaGo program was being revamped and adjusted right up to the actual tournament, a typical kind of last-ditch developer contortions that many of us have done when trying to get the last bit of added edge into something that is about to be demonstrated.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This was a monumental competition that had garnered global interest.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Human players of Go were doubtful that the AlphaGo program would win. Many AI techies were doubtful that AlphaGo would win. Even the AlphaGo developers were unsure of how well the program would do, including the stay-awake-at-night fears that the AlphaGo program would hit a bug or go into a kind of delusional mode and make outright mistakes and play foolishly.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A million dollars in prize money was put into the pot for the competition. There would be five Go games played, one per day, along with associated rules about taking breaks, etc. Some predicted that Sedol would handily win all five games, doing so without cracking a sweat. AI pundits were clinging to the hope that AlphaGo would win at least one of the five games, and otherwise, present itself as a respectable level of Go player throughout the contest.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In the first match, AlphaGo won.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This was pretty much a worldwide shocker. Sedol was taken aback. Lots of Go players were surprised that a computer program could compete and beat someone at Sedol’s level of play. Everyone began to give some street cred to the AlphaGo program and the efforts by the AI developers.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Tension grew for the next match.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the second game, it was anticipated that Sedol might significantly change his approach to the contest. Perhaps he had been overconfident coming into the competition, some harshly asserted, and the loss of the first game would awaken him to the importance of putting all his concentration into the tournament. Or, possibly he had played as though he was competing with a lesser capable player and thus was not pulling out all the stops to try and win the match.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>What happened in the second game?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Turns out that AlphaGo prevailed, again, and also did something that was seemingly remarkable for those that avidly play Go. On the 37</span><span>th</span><span>\\xa0move of the match, the AlphaGo program opted to make placement onto the Go board in a spot that nobody especially anticipated. It was a surprise move, coming partway through a match that otherwise was relatively conventional in the nature of the moves being made by both Sedol and AlphaGo.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>At the time, in real-time, rampant speculation was that the move was an utter gaffe on the part of the AlphaGo program.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Instead, it became famous as a novel move, known now as “Move 37” and heralded in Go and used colloquially overall to suggest any instance when AI does something of a novel or unexpected manner.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In the third match, AlphaGo won again, now having successfully beaten Sedol in a 3-out-of-5 winner competition. They\\xa0continued though to\\xa0play a fourth and a fifth game.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>During the fourth game, things were tight as usual and the match play was going head-to-head (well, head versus AI). Put yourself into the shoes of Sedol. In one sense, he wasn’t just a Go player, he was somehow representing all of humanity (an unfair and misguided viewpoint, but pervasive anyway), and the pressure was on him to win at least one game. Just even one game would be something to hang your hat on, and bolster faith in mankind (again, a nonsensical way to look at it).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>At the seventy-eighth move of the fourth game, Sedol made a so-called “wedge” play that was not conventional and surprised onlookers. The next move by AlphaGo was rotten and diminished the likelihood of a win by the AI system. After additional play, ultimately AlphaGo tossed in the towel and resigned from the match, thus Sedol finally had a win against the AI in his belt. He ended-up losing the fifth game, so AlphaGo won four games, Sedol won one). His move also became famous, generally known as “Move 78” in the lore of Go playing.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Something else that is worthwhile to know about involves the overarching strategy that AlphaGo was crafted to utilize.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>When you play a game, let’s say connect-the-dots, you can aim to grab as many squares at each moment of play, doing so under the belief that inevitably you will then win by the accumulation of those tactically-oriented successes. Human players of Go are often apt to play that way, as it can be said too of chess players, and nearly any kind of game playing altogether.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Another approach involves playing to win, even if only by the thinnest of margins, as long as you win. In that case, you might not be motivated for each tactical move to gain near-term territory or score immediate points, and be willing instead to play a larger scope game per se. The proverbial mantra is that if you are shortsighted, you might win some of the battles, but could eventually lose the war. Therefore, it might be a better strategy to keep your eye on the prize, winning the war, albeit if it means that there are battles and skirmishes to be lost along the way.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The AI developers devised AlphaGo with that kind of macro-perspective underlying how the AI system functioned.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Humans can have an especially hard time choosing at the moment to make a move that might look bad or ill-advised, such as giving up territory, finding themselves to be unable to grit their teeth, and taking a lump or two during play. The embarrassment at the instant is difficult to offset by betting that it is going to ultimately be okay, and you will prevail in the end.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For an AI system, there is no semblance of that kind of sentiment involved, and it is all about calculated odds and probabilities.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Now that we’ve covered the legendary Go match, let’s consider some lessons learned about novelty.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The “Move 38” made by the AI system was not magical. It was an interesting move, for sure, and the AI developers later indicated that the move was one that the AI had calculated would rarely be undertaken by a human player.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This can be interpreted in two ways (at least).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One interpretation is that a human player would not make that move because humans are right and know that it would be a lousy move.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Another interpretation is that humans would not make that move due to a belief that the move is unwise, but this could be a result of the humans insufficiently assessing the ultimate value of the move, in the long-run, and getting caught up in a shorter time frame semblance of play.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In this instance, it turned out to be a good move—maybe a brilliant move—and turned the course of the game to the advantage of the AI. Thus, what looked like brilliance was in fact a calculated move that few humans would have imagined as valuable and for which jostled humans to rethink how they think about such matters.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some useful recap lessons:</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Showcasing Human Self-Limited Insight.</span></b><span>\\xa0When the AI does something seemingly novel, it might be viewed as novel simply because humans have already predetermined what is customary and anything beyond that is blunted by the assumption that it is unworthy or mistaken. You could say that we are mentally trapped by our own drawing of the lines of what is considered as inside versus outside the box.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Humans Exploiting AI For Added Insight</span></b><span>. Humans can gainfully assess an AI-powered novelty to potentially re-calibrate human thinking on a given topic, enlarging our understanding via leveraging something that the AI, via its vast calculative capacity, might detect or spot that we have not yet so ascertained.

The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Self-Driving Cars And Acts Of Novelty</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You could say that the AI is playing a game, a driving game, requiring tactical decision-making and strategic planning, akin to when playing Go or chess, though in this case involving life-or-death matters driving a multi-ton car on our public roadways.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Our base assumption is that the AI driving system is going to always take a tried-and-true approach to any driving decisions. This assumption is somewhat shaped around a notion that AI is a type of robot or automata that is bereft of any human biases or human foibles.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In reality, there is no reason to make this kind of assumption. Yes, we can generally rule out the aspect that the AI is not going to display the emotion of a human ilk, and we also know that the AI will not be drunk or DUI in its driving efforts. Nonetheless, if the AI has been trained using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), it can pick up subtleties of human behavioral patterns in the data about human driving, out of which it will likewise utilize or mimic in choosing its driving actions (for example, see my column postings involving an analysis of potential racial biases in AI and the possibility of gender biases).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Turning back to the topic of novelty, let’s ponder a specific use case.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A few years ago, I was driving on an open highway, going at the prevailing speed of around 65 miles per hour, and something nearly unimaginable occurred. A car coming toward me in the opposing lane, and likely traveling at around 60 to 70 miles per hour, suddenly and unexpectedly veered into my lane. It was one of those moments that you cannot anticipate.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There did not appear to be any reason for the other driver to be headed toward me, in my lane of traffic, and coming at me for an imminent and bone-chillingly terrifying head-on collision. If there had been debris on the other lane, it might have been a clue that perhaps this other driver was simply trying to swing around the obstruction. No debris. If there was a slower moving car, the driver might have wanted to do a fast end-around to get past it. Nope, there was absolutely no discernible basis for this radical and life-threatening maneuver.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>What would you do?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Come on, hurry, the clock is ticking, and you have just a handful of split seconds to make a life-or-death driving decision.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You could stay in your lane and hope that the other driver realizes the error of their ways, opting to veer back into their lane at the last moment. Or, you could proactively go into the opposing lane, giving the other driver a clear path in your lane, but this could be a chancy game of chicken whereby the other driver chooses to go back into their lane (plus, there was other traffic further behind that driver, so going into the opposing lane was quite dicey).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Okay, so do you stay in your lane or veer away into the opposing lane?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I dare say that most people would be torn between those two options. Neither one is palatable.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose the AI of a self-driving car was faced with the same circumstance.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>What would the AI do?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The odds are that even if the AI had been fed with thousands upon thousands of miles of driving via a database about human driving while undergoing the ML/DL training, there might not be any instances of a head-to-head nature and thus no prior pattern to utilize for making this onerous decision.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Anyway, here’s a twist.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Imagine that the AI calculated the probabilities involving which way to go, and in some computational manner came to the conclusion that the self-driving car should go into the ditch that was at the right of the roadway. This was intended to avoid entirely a collision with the other car (the AI estimated that a head-on collision would be near-certain death for the occupants). The AI estimated that going into the ditch at such high speed would indisputably wreck the car and cause great bodily injury to the occupants, but the odds of assured death were (let’s say) calculated as lower than the head-on option possibilities (this is a variant of the infamous Trolley Problem, as covered in my columns).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I’m betting that you would concede that most humans would be relatively unwilling to aim purposely into that ditch, which they know for sure is going to be a wreck and potential death, while instead willing (reluctantly) to take a hoped-for chance of either veering into the other lane or staying on course and wishing for the best.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In some sense, the AI might seem to have made a novel choice. It is one that (we’ll assume) few humans would have given any explicit thought toward.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Returning to the earlier recap of the points about AI novelty, you could suggest that in this example, the AI has exceeded a human self-imposed limitation by the AI having considered otherwise “unthinkable” options. From this, perhaps we can learn to broaden our view for options that otherwise don’t seem apparent.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The other recap element was that the AI novelty can be a dual-edged sword.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>If the AI did react by driving into the ditch, and you were inside the self-driving car, and you got badly injured, would you later believe that the AI acted in a novel manner or that it acted mistakenly or adversely?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some might say that if you lived to ask that question, apparently the AI made the right choice. The counter-argument is that if the AI had gone with one of the other choices, perhaps you would have sailed right past the other car and not gotten a single scratch.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Expect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Conclusion</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For those of you wondering what actually did happen, my lucky stars were looking over me that day, and I survived with nothing more than a close call.

That becomes really complicated because we don’t know what it really means.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Schuelke-Leech started her career as an engineer, then decided to pursue a PhD in public policy, a background which\\xa0enables\\xa0her to see things as an engineer and as a social scientist. “I got a PhD in social science, and have been pulled back into the engineering world where I am involved in AI projects, but based in a mechanical engineering faculty,” she said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>An engineering project has a goal, which describes the purpose, a set of needed features and functions, and a set of constraints, such as budget and timeline “The standards and regulations become part of the constraints,” she said. “If I know I have to comply with it, I will do that. But if you tell me it’s a good thing to do, I may or may not adopt that.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Schuelke-Leech also serves as chair of the IEEE Society’s Committee on the Social Implications of Technology Standards. She commented, “Voluntary compliance standards such as from the IEEE are essential from people in the industry getting together to say this is what we think we should do as an industry.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some standards, such as around interoperability, do not have the force of law but engineers comply with them, so their systems will work. Other standards are described as good practices, but are not required to be followed. “Whether it helps me to achieve my goal or hinders me getting to the objective, is how the engineer looks at it,” she said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>The Pursuit of AI Ethics Described as “Messy and Difficult”</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21143\" style=\"width: 178px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-21143\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22SaraJordan-2-178x300.jpeg\" width=\"178\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21143\">Sara Jordan, senior counsel, Future of Privacy Forum</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>Sara Jordan, senior counsel with the Future of Privacy Forum, in the session with Schuelke-Leech, works on the ethical challenges of AI and machine learning and is an active member of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics and Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. “Ethics is messy and difficult, and is context-laden. We have a proliferation of theories, frameworks and constructs,” she said, adding, “The practice of ethical AI will require repeatable, rigorous thinking in context.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Schuelke-Leech offered, “Ethics is not an end outcome. It is the process being followed. But I’m also looking for someone to tell me what I need to do to do my job, to tell me how to be ethical, what rules I’m supposed to follow, to take away the ambiguity.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Engineers shut down when you get into funny words that they don’t understand, like ‘ontological,’ They’ve been taking math and science since they were 13-years-old,” she said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>She has found it difficult to get engineers involved in attempts to draft standards for ethical AI. “Engineers are missing from the table,” she said. “The debates about whether we can get to 100%\\xa0ethical are\\xa0conversations\\xa0engineers do not have.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>She concluded, “If their managers tell them to figure it out, they will do so. We need to help the engineers cross the bridge halfway. It is essential that social scientists and engineers don’t give up on this.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Leader’s Panel Described Integration of Ethics into AI Development Practices</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The topic of ethics in AI is coming up more in the curriculum of the US Naval War College of Newport, R.I., which was established to provide advanced study for US Navy officers and now educates leaders from all services. Ross Coffey, a military professor of National Security Affairs at the institution, participated in a Leader&#8217;s Panel on AI, Ethics and Smart Policy at AI World Government.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“The ethical literacy of students increases over time as they are working with these ethical issues, which is why it is an urgent matter because it will take a long time,” Coffey said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Panel member Carole Smith, a senior research scientist with Carnegie Mellon University who\\xa0studies human-machine interaction, has been involved in integrating ethics into AI systems development since 2015. She cited the importance of “demystifying” AI.\\xa0\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“My interest is in understanding what kind of interactions we can create where the human is appropriately trusting the system they are working with, not over- or under-trusting it,” she said, adding, “In general, people have higher expectations than they should for the systems.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As an example, she cited the Tesla Autopilot features, which implement self-driving car capability to a degree but not completely. “People assume the system can do a much broader set of activities than it was designed to do. Helping people understand the limitations of a system is important. Everyone needs to understand the expected outcomes of a system and what some of the mitigating circumstances might be,” she said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Panel member Taka Ariga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, sees a gap in AI literacy for the young workforce coming into the federal government.\\xa0 “Data scientist training does not always include ethics. Accountable AI is a laudable construct, but I’m not sure everyone buys into it. We need their responsibility to go beyond technical aspects and be accountable to the end user we are trying to serve,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Panel moderator Alison Brooks, PhD, research VP of Smart Cities and Communities at the IDC market research firm, asked whether principles of ethical AI can be shared across the boundaries of nations.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“We will have a limited ability for every nation to align on the same exact approach, but we will have to align in some ways on what we will not allow AI to do, and what people will also be responsible for,” stated Smith of CMU.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The panelists credited the European Commission for being out front on these issues of ethics, especially in the enforcement realm.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Ross of the Naval War Colleges acknowledged the importance of finding common ground around AI ethics. “From a military perspective, our interoperability needs to go to a whole new level. We need to find common ground with our partners and our allies on what we will allow AI to do and what we will not allow AI to do.” Unfortunately, “I don’t know if that discussion is happening,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Discussion on AI ethics could perhaps be pursued as part of certain existing treaties, Smith suggested</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The many AI ethics principles, frameworks,\\xa0and road maps being offered in many federal agencies can be challenging to follow and be made consistent. Take said, “I am hopeful that over the next year or two, we will see a\\xa0coalescing.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more information and access to recorded sessions, go to\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government</span></a><span>.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

We might have access to big data, but it might not be the right thing to do,” to work with it in all cases.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Things are accelerating, which is raising expectations. When panel member Vivek Rao, lecturer and researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, was working on his PhD, a paper on natural language processing might be a master’s thesis. “Now we assign it as a homework assignment with a two-day turnaround. We have an enormous amount of compute power that was not available even two years ago,”\\xa0he said of his students, who he described as “digital natives”\\xa0with high expectations of what AI makes possible.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21137\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21137\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22RachelDzombak-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21137\">Rachel\\xa0Dzombak, digital transformation lead, Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>Panel moderator Rachel\\xa0Dzombak, digital transformation lead at the\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.sei.cmu.edu/\"><span>Software Engineering Institute\\xa0</span></a><span>of Carnegie Mellon University, asked the panelists what is unique about working on AI in the government.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Aronson said the government cannot get too far ahead with the technology, or the users will not know how to interact with it. “We’re not building iPhones,” she said. “We have experimentation going on, and we are always looking ahead, anticipating the future, so we can make the most cost-effective decisions. In the government right now, we are seeing the convergence of the emerging generation and the close-to-retiring generation, who we also have to serve.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Early in her career, Aronson did not want to work in the government. “I thought it meant you were either in the armed services or the Peace Corps,” she said. “But what I learned after a while is what motivates federal employees is service to larger, problem-solving institutions. We are trying to solve really big problems of equity and diversity, and getting food to people and keeping people safe. People that work for the government are dedicated to those missions.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>She referred to her two children in their 20s, who like the idea of service, but in “tiny chunks,” meaning, “They don’t look at the government as a place where they have freedom, and they can do whatever they want. They see it as a lockdown situation. But it’s really not.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Berkeley Students Learn About Role of Government in Disaster Response\\xa0</span></b><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Rao of Berkeley said his students are seeing wildfires in California and asking who is working on the challenge of doing something about them. When he tells them it is almost always local, state and federal government entities, “Students are generally surprised to find that out.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In one example, he developed a course on innovation in disaster response, in collaboration with CMU and the Department of Defense, the Army Futures Lab and Coast Guard search and rescue. “This was eye-opening for students,” he said. At the outset, two of 35 students expressed interest in a federal government career. By the end of the course, 10 of the 35 students were expressing interest. One of them was hired by the Naval Surface Warfare Center outside Corona, Calif. as a software engineer, Rao said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Aronson described the process of bringing on new federal employees as a “heavy lift,” suggesting, “if we could prepare in advance, it would move a lot faster.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21140\" style=\"width: 188px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-21140\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22BryanLane-2-188x300.jpeg\" width=\"188\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21140\">Bryan Lane, director of Data &amp;\\xa0AI,\\xa0General\\xa0Services Administration</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>Asked by\\xa0Dzombak\\xa0what skill sets and mindsets are seen as essential to AI engineering teams, panel member Bryan Lane, director of Data &amp; AI at the General Services Administration (who announced during the session that he is taking on a new role at FDIC), said resiliency is a necessary quality.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lane is a technology executive within the GSA IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoE) with over 15 years of experience leading advanced analytics and technology initiatives. He has led the GSA partnership with the DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).\\xa0</span><i><span>[Ed. Note: Known as “the Jake.”]\\xa0</span></i><span>Lane also is the founder of\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.dataxd.io/\"><span>DATA XD.</span></a><span>\\xa0He also has experience in industry, managing acquisition portfolios.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“The most important thing about resilient teams going on an AI journey is that you need to be ready for the unexpected, and the mission persists,” he said.\\xa0“If you are all aligned on the importance of the mission, the team can be held together.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Good Sign that Team Members Acknowledge Having “Never Done This Before”</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Regarding mindset, he said more of his team members are coming to him and saying, “I’ve never done this before.” He sees that as a good sign that offers an opportunity to talk about risk and alternative solutions. “When your team has the psychological safety to say that they don’t know something,” Lane sees it as positive. “The focus is always on what you have done and what you have delivered. Rarely is the focus on what you have not done before and what you want to grow into,” he said,</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Aronson has found it challenging to get AI projects off the ground. “It’s hard to tell management that you have a use case or problem to solve and want to go at it, and there is a 50-50 chance it will get done, and you don’t know how much it’s going to cost,” she said. “It comes down to articulating the rationale and convincing others it’s the right thing to do to move forward.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Rao said he talks to students about experimentation and having an experimental mindset. “AI tools can be easily accessible, but they can mask the challenges you can encounter. When you apply the vision API, for example in the context of challenges in your business or government agency, things may not be smooth,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Moderator\\xa0Dzombak\\xa0asked the panelists how they build teams. Arson said, “You need a mix of people.” She has tried “communities of practice” around solving specific problems, where people can come and go. “You bring people together around a problem and not a tool,” she said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lane seconded this. “I really have stopped focusing on tools in general,” he said. He ran experiments at JAIC in accounting, finance and other areas. “We found it’s not really about the tools. It’s about getting the right people together to understand the problems, then looking at the tools available,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lane said he sets up “cross-functional teams” that are “a little more formal than a community of interest.”\\xa0He has found them to be effective for working together on a problem for maybe 45 days. He also likes working with customers of the needed services inside the organization, and has seen customers learn about data management and AI as a result. “We will pick up one or two along the way who become advocates for accelerating AI throughout the organization,” Lane said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lane sees it taking five years to work out proven methods of thinking, working,\\xa0and best practices for developing AI systems to serve the government. He mentioned\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov/\"><span>The Opportunity Project</span></a><span>\\xa0(TOP) of the US Census Bureau, begun in 2016 to work on challenges such as ocean plastic pollution, COVID-19 economic recovery and disaster response. TOP has engaged in over 135 public-facing projects in that time, and has over 1,300 alumni including developers, designers, community leaders, data and policy experts, students and government agencies.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“It’s based on a way of thinking and how to organize work,” Lane said. “We have to scale the model of delivery, but five years from now, we will have enough proof of concept to know what works and what does not.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Learn more at\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government</span></a><span>, at the\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.sei.cmu.edu/\"><span>Software Engineering Institute</span></a><span>, at\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.dataxd.io/\"><span>DATA XD</span></a><span>\\xa0and at\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov/\"><span>The Opportunity Project</span></a><span>.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

The effort was spurred by a desire to ground the AI accountability framework in the reality of an engineer’s day-to-day work. The resulting framework was first published in June as what Ariga described as “version 1.0.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Seeking to Bring a “High-Altitude Posture” Down to Earth</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“We found the AI accountability framework had a very high-altitude posture,” Ariga said. “These are laudable ideals and aspirations, but what do they mean to the day-to-day AI practitioner? There is a gap, while we see AI proliferating across the government.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“We landed on a lifecycle approach,” which steps through stages of design, development, deployment and continuous monitoring. The development effort stands on four “pillars” of Governance, Data, Monitoring and Performance.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Governance reviews what the organization has put in place to oversee the AI efforts. “The chief AI officer might be in place, but what does it mean? Can the person make changes? Is it multidisciplinary?”\\xa0 At a system level within this pillar, the team will review individual AI models to see if they were “purposely deliberated.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the Data pillar,\\xa0his team will examine how the training data was evaluated, how representative it is, and is it functioning as intended.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the Performance pillar, the team will consider the “societal impact” the AI system will have in deployment, including whether it risks a violation of the Civil Rights Act. “Auditors have a long-standing track record of evaluating equity. We grounded the evaluation of AI to a proven system,” Ariga said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring, he said, “AI is not a technology you deploy and forget.” he said. “We are preparing to continually monitor for model drift and the fragility of algorithms, and we are scaling the AI appropriately.” The evaluations will determine whether the AI system continues to meet the need “or whether a sunset is more appropriate,” Ariga said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>He is part of the discussion with NIST on an overall government AI accountability framework. “We don’t want an ecosystem of confusion,” Ariga said. “We want a whole-government approach. We feel that this is a useful first step in pushing high-level ideas down to an altitude meaningful to the practitioners of AI.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>DIU Assesses Whether Proposed Projects Meet Ethical AI Guidelines</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21134\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21134\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22BryceGoodman-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21134\">Bryce Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning, the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>At the DIU, Goodman is involved in a similar effort to develop guidelines for developers of AI projects within the government.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Projects Goodman has been involved with implementation of AI for humanitarian assistance and disaster response, predictive maintenance,\\xa0to\\xa0counter-disinformation,\\xa0and predictive health. He heads the Responsible AI Working Group. He is a faculty member of Singularity University, has a wide range of consulting clients from inside and outside the government, and holds a PhD in AI and Philosophy from the University of Oxford.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The DOD in February 2020 adopted five areas of\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2091996/dod-adopts-ethical-principles-for-artificial-intelligence/\"><span>Ethical Principles for AI</span></a><span>\\xa0after 15 months of consulting with AI experts in commercial industry, government academia and the American public.\\xa0 These areas are: Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable and Governable.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Those are well-conceived, but it’s not obvious to an engineer how to translate them into a specific project requirement,” Good said in a presentation on Responsible AI Guidelines at the AI World Government event. “That’s the gap we are trying to fill.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Before the DIU even considers a project, they run through the ethical principles to see if it passes muster. Not all projects do. “There needs to be an option to say the technology is not there or the problem is not compatible with AI,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All project stakeholders, including from commercial vendors and within the government, need to be able to test and validate and go beyond minimum legal requirements to meet the principles. “The law is not moving as fast as AI, which is why these principles are important,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Also, collaboration is going on across the government to ensure values are being preserved and maintained. “Our intention with these guidelines is not to try to achieve perfection, but to avoid catastrophic consequences,” Goodman said. “It can be difficult to get a group to agree on what the best outcome is, but it’s easier to get the group to agree on what the worst-case outcome is.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The DIU guidelines along with case studies and supplemental materials will be published on the DIU website “soon,” Goodman said, to help others leverage the experience.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Here are Questions DIU Asks Before Development Starts</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The first step in the guidelines is to define the task.\\xa0 “That&#8217;s the single most important question,” he said. “Only if there is an advantage, should you use AI.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Next is a benchmark, which needs to be set up front to know if the project\\xa0has delivered.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Next, he evaluates ownership of the candidate data. “Data is critical to the AI system and is the place where a lot of problems can exist.” Goodman said. “We need a certain contract on who owns the data. If ambiguous, this can lead to problems.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Next, Goodman’s team wants a sample of data to evaluate. Then, they need to know how and why the information was collected. “If consent was given for one purpose, we cannot use it for another purpose without re-obtaining consent,” he said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Next, the team asks if the responsible stakeholders are identified, such as pilots who could be affected if a component fails.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Next, the responsible mission-holders must be identified. “We need a single individual for this,” Goodman said. “Often we have a tradeoff between the performance of an algorithm and its\\xa0explainability. We might have to decide between the two. Those kinds of decisions have an ethical component and an operational component. So we need to have someone who is accountable for those decisions, which is consistent with the chain of command in the DOD.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Finally, the DIU team requires a process for rolling back if things go wrong. “We need to be cautious about abandoning the previous system,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Once all these questions are answered in a satisfactory way, the team moves on to the development phase.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In lessons learned, Goodman said, “Metrics are key. And simply measuring accuracy might not be adequate. We need to be able to measure success.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Also, fit the technology to the task. “High risk applications require low-risk technology. And when potential harm is significant, we need to have high confidence in the technology,” he said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Another lesson learned is to set expectations with commercial vendors. “We need vendors to be transparent,” he said. ”When someone says they have a proprietary algorithm they cannot tell us about, we are very wary. We view the relationship as a collaboration. It’s the only way we can ensure\\xa0that the AI\\xa0is developed responsibly.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Lastly, “AI is not magic. It will not solve everything. It should only be used when necessary and only when we can prove it will provide an advantage.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Learn more at\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government</span></a><span>, at the\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/\"><span>Government Accountability Office,\\xa0</span></a><span>at the</span><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-519sp\"><span>\\xa0AI Accountability Framework</span></a><span>\\xa0and at the\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.diu.mil/\"><span>Defense Innovation Unit</span></a><span>\\xa0site.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

The company was founded by CEO Dylan Fox in 2017 and has received backing from Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, as well as NVIDIA.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Fox has an unusual background for a high tech entrepreneur. He is a graduate of George Washington University with a degree in business administration, business economics,\\xa0and public policy. He got a job as a software engineer for machine learning in the emerging product lab of Cisco in San Francisco, working on deep neural networks and machine learning. He got the idea for\\xa0AssemblyAi\\xa0and attracted capital from Y Combinator, which enabled him to hire data scientists and data engineers to get the technology off the ground.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Asked in an interview with\\xa0</span><i><span>AI Trends</span></i><span>\\xa0how he made this transition from undergrad in business administration and economics to high-tech entrepreneur, Fox said, “I taught myself how to program, which led me to a path of machine learning. I was looking for a harder software challenge, which led to natural language processing, which took me to Cisco.” They were working on Siri for the Enterprise for Apple at the time,</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To speed up the work, Cisco was looking to acquire speech recognition software; Fox was in the catbird’s seat for the search. “We looked at Nuance,” for example, acknowledged as a market leader and owner of more speech recognition software than its competitors. (The acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft for $19.6 billion is expected to be finalized by year-end.) The young, budding entrepreneur was not impressed. “It was crazy how bad all the options were from an accuracy and a developer point of view,” he stated.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>He was impressed by Twilio, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2008, which that year released the Twilio Voice API to make and receive phone calls hosted in the cloud. The company has since raised $103 million in venture capital. “They were setting new standards for a good API for developers,” Fox said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Fox’s idea was to use AI and machine learning to achieve “super accurate results, and make it easy for developers to incorporate the API into their products. One customer is\\xa0CallRail, offering call tracking and marketing analytics software, which plans to incorporate\\xa0AssembyAI’s\\xa0API to gain insight into why people are calling. Other customers include NBC and the Wall Street\\xa0Journal, using the product to transcribe content and interviews, and provide closed captioning.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“We’ve been working on building as close to human speech recognition quality as possible. It’s been a lot of work” Fox said. He expects to reach that plateau in 2022.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>He targets companies incorporating speech recognition into their products and makes it easy to buy. Customers pay on a usage basis; for every second of audio transcribed,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\xa0charges a fraction of a penny. Clients get billed monthly. If a customer uses 10 hours a month, it costs about nine dollars. If a customer uses a million hours a month, it costs about $900,000.\\xa0\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Voice recognition is a hot market. “Many new startups are being launched,” Fox said, providing opportunity. “Many interesting new businesses are being built on voice data.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>AssemblyAI’s\\xa0product can detect sensitive topics such as hate speech and profanity, so customers can save on human content moderation.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Asked to describe what differentiates his technology, Fox said, “We are an experienced team of deep learning researchers,” with experience from companies including BMW, Apple,\\xa0and Facebook. “We build very large, very accurate deep learning models that have recognition results far more accurate than a traditional machine learning approach. We build really large models using advanced neural network technologies.” He compared the approach to what\\xa0OpenAI\\xa0uses to develop its GPT-3 large language model.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In addition, they build AI features on top of the transcriptions, to provide summaries of audio and video content, which can be searched and indexed. “It goes beyond just transcription,” Fox said.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The company currently has 25 employees and expects to double in about four months. Business has been good. “There is an explosion of audio and video data online and customers want to be able to take advantage of it, so we see a lot of demand,” Fox said.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Learn more at\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.assemblyai.com/\"><span>AssemblyAI.</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall. The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous. It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming.\\xa0The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all. Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects. It is just plain bad.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed. This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt\\xa0exemplar\\xa0of the problems associated with knowledge. Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device. In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category. This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered. Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first. In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Round and round we can go.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Maybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful. Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent. Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s the rub.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think. There are two major potential gotchas.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>First, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things. If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Secondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms. It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Plenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and then exploitation of forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware that many would scoff at this allegation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes potential forbidden knowledge. The technology and technological elements are relatively ho-hum, they would argue. You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the ballpark of forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that path. Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at the next turn.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One area where AI is being actively used is to create Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We are gradually seeing the emergence of self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships, self-driving submersibles, etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Today’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent of AI-based, true self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s an intriguing question that has arisen:\\xa0</span><i><span>Might the crafting of AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?</span></i><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Before jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when referring to true self-driving cars.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Self-Driving Cars And Forbidden Knowledge</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All occupants will be passengers.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The AI is doing the driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Per the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars. Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Generally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5. To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Not everyone would agree with that assumption. Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4. Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley. An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end. In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5. Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Aha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside. In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To some, this seems\\xa0farfetched.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>They would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s their logic. Humans are able to drive cars. Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car. Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Seems like pretty ironclad logic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning. With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us. When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Attempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon). Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too. It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>If you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge. On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern. The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge.

            "<p><span>The AI stack defined by Carnegie Mellon University is fundamental to the approach being taken by the US Army for its AI development platform efforts, according to Isaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist at the US Army AI Integration Center, speaking at the </span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government</span></a><span> event held in-person and virtually from Alexandria, Va., last week.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“If we want to move the Army from legacy systems through digital modernization, one of the biggest issues I have found is the difficulty in abstracting away the differences in applications,” he said. “The most important part of digital transformation is the middle layer, the platform that makes it easier to be on the cloud or on a local computer.” The desire is to be able to move your software platform to another platform, with the same ease with which a new smartphone carries over the user’s contacts and histories.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Ethics cuts across all layers of the AI application stack, which positions the planning stage at the top, followed by decision support, modeling, machine learning, massive data management and the device layer or platform at the bottom.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“I am advocating that we think of the stack as a core infrastructure and a way for applications to be deployed and not to be siloed in our approach,” he said. “We need to create a development environment for a globally-distributed workforce.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The Army has been working on a Common Operating Environment Software (Coes) platform, first announced in 2017, a design for DOD work that is scalable, agile, modular, portable and open. “It is suitable for a broad range of AI projects,” Faber said. For executing the effort, “The devil is in the details,” he said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The Army is working with CMU and private companies on a prototype platform, including with </span><a href=\"https://visimo.ai/\"><span>Visimo</span></a><span> of Coraopolis, Pa., which offers AI development services. Faber said he prefers to collaborate and coordinate with private industry rather than buying products off the shelf. “The problem with that is, you are stuck with the value you are being provided by that one vendor, which is usually not designed for the challenges of DOD networks,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Army Trains a Range of Tech Teams in AI</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The Army engages in AI workforce development efforts for several teams, including:  leadership, professionals with graduate degrees; technical staff, which is put through training to get certified; and AI users. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Tech teams in the Army have different areas of focus include: general purpose software development, operational data science, deployment which includes analytics, and a machine learning operations team, such as a large team required to build a computer vision system. “As folks come through the workforce, they need a place to collaborate, build and share,” Faber said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Types of projects include diagnostic, which might be combining streams of historical data, predictive and prescriptive, which recommends a course of action based on a prediction. “At the far end is AI; you don’t start with that,” said Faber. The developer has to solve three problems: data engineering, the AI development platform, which he called “the green bubble,” and the deployment platform, which he called “the red bubble.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“These are mutually exclusive and all interconnected. Those teams of different people need to programmatically coordinate. Usually a good project team will have people from each of those bubble areas,” he said. “If you have not done this yet, do not try to solve the green bubble problem. It makes no sense to pursue AI until you have an operational need.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Asked by a participant which group is the most difficult to reach and train, Faber said without hesitation, “The hardest to reach are the executives. They need to learn what the value is to be provided by the AI ecosystem. The biggest challenge is how to communicate that value,” he said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Jean-Charles Lede, autonomy tech advisor for the US Air Force, Office of Scientific Research, said,” I would point to decision advantages at the edge, supporting pilots and operators, and decisions at the back, for mission and resource planning.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Krista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor, said, “Natural language processing is an opportunity to open the doors to AI in the Department of Labor,” she said. “Ultimately, we are dealing with data on people, programs, and organizations.”  </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Savoie asked what are the big risks and dangers the panelists see when implementing AI. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the General Services Administration (GSA), said in a typical IT organization using traditional software development, the impact of a decision by a developer only goes so far. With AI, “You have to consider the impact on a whole class of people, constituents, and stakeholders. With a simple change in algorithms, you could be delaying benefits to millions of people or making incorrect inferences at scale. That’s the most important risk,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He said he asks his contract partners to have “humans in the loop and humans on the loop.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Kinnard seconded this, saying, “We have no intention of removing humans from the loop. It’s really about empowering people to make better decisions.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>She emphasized the importance of monitoring the AI models after they are deployed. “Models can drift as the data underlying the changes,” she said. “So you need a level of critical thinking to not only do the task, but to assess whether what the AI model is doing is acceptable.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>She added, “We have built out use cases and partnerships across the government to make sure we’re implementing responsible AI. We will never replace people with algorithms.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lede of the Air Force said, “We often have use cases where the data does not exist. We cannot explore 50 years of war data, so we use simulation. The risk is in teaching an algorithm that you have a ‘simulation to real gap’ that is a real risk. You are not sure how the algorithms will map to the real world.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Chaudhry emphasized the importance of a testing strategy for AI systems. He warned of developers “who get enamored with a tool and forget the purpose of the exercise.” He recommended the development manager design in independent verification and validation strategy. “Your testing, that is where you have to focus your energy as a leader. The leader needs an idea in mind, before committing resources, on how they will justify whether the investment was a success.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lede of the Air Force talked about the importance of explainability. “I am a technologist. I don’t do laws. The ability for the AI function to explain in a way a human can interact with, is important. The AI is a partner that we have a dialogue with, instead of the AI coming up with a conclusion that we have no way of verifying,” he said. </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Pamela Isom, Director of the AI and Technology Office at the DOE, who spoke on Advancing Trustworthy AI and ML Techniques for Mitigating Agency Risks, has been involved in proliferating the use of AI across the agency for several years. With an emphasis on applied AI and data science, she oversees risk mitigation policies and standards and has been involved with applying AI to save lives, fight fraud, and strengthen the cybersecurity infrastructure.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>She emphasized the need for the AI project effort to be part of a strategic portfolio. “My office is there to drive a holistic view on AI and to mitigate risk by bringing us together to address challenges,” she said. The effort is assisted by the DOE’s AI and Technology Office, which is focused on transforming the DOE into a world-leading AI enterprise by accelerating research, development, delivery and the adoption of AI.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“I am telling my organization to be mindful of the fact that you can have tons and tons of data, but it might not be representative,” she said. Her team looks at examples from international partners, industry, academia and other agencies for outcomes “we can trust” from systems incorporating AI.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“We know that AI is disruptive, in trying to do what humans do and do it better,” she said. “It is beyond human capability; it goes beyond data in spreadsheets; it can tell me what I’m going to do next before I contemplate it myself. It’s that powerful,” she said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>As a result, close attention must be paid to data sources. “AI is vital to the economy and our national security. We need precision; we need algorithms we can trust; we need accuracy. We don’t need biases,” Isom said, adding, “And don’t forget that you need to monitor the output of the models long after they have been deployed.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Executive Orders Guide GSA AI Work</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Executive Order 14028, a detailed set of actions to address the cybersecurity of government agencies, issued in May of this year, and Executive Order 13960, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the Federal government, issued in December 2020, provide valuable guides to her work. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>To help manage the risk of AI development and deployment, Isom has produced the AI Risk Management Playbook, which provides guidance around system features and mitigation techniques. It also has a filter for ethical and trustworthy principles which are considered throughout AI lifecycle stages and risk types. Plus, the playbook ties to relevant Executive Orders.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>And it provides examples, such as your results came in at 80% accuracy, but you wanted 90%. “Something is wrong there,” Isom said, adding, “The playbook helps you look at these types of problems and what you can do to mitigate risk, and what factors you should weigh as you design and build your project.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>While internal to DOE at present, the agency is looking into next steps for an external version. “We will share it with other federal agencies soon,” she said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

Note: A petabyte is 1,000 terabytes.] </span></i><span>“Also ask industry partners about their strategies and processes on how they do macro and micro trend analysis, and what their experience has been in the deployment of bots such as in Robotic Process Automation, and how they demonstrate sustainability as a result of drift of data.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He also asks potential industry partners to</span><b><span> describe the AI talent on their team</span></b><span> or what talent they can access. If the company is weak on AI talent, Chaudhry would ask, “If you buy something, how will you know you got what you wanted when you have no way of evaluating it?”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He added, “A best practice in implementing AI is defining how you train your workforce to leverage AI tools, techniques and practices, and to define how you grow and mature your workforce. Access to talent leads to either success or failure in AI projects, especially when it comes to scaling a pilot up to a fully deployed system.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In another best practice, Chaudhry recommended examining the industry partner’s </span><b><span>access to financial capital.</span></b><span> “AI is a field where the flow of capital is highly volatile. “You cannot predict or project that you will spend X amount of dollars this year to get where you want to be,” he said, because an AI development team may need to explore another hypothesis, or clean up some data that may not be transparent or is potentially biased. “If you don’t have access to funding, it is a risk your project will fail,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another best practice is </span><b><span>access to logistical capital</span></b><span>, such as the data  that sensors collect for an AI IoT system. “AI requires an enormous amount of data that is authoritative and timely. Direct access to that data is critical,” Chaudhry said. He recommended that data sharing agreements  be in place with organizations relevant to the AI system. “You might not need it right away, but having access to the data, so you could immediately use it and to have thought through the privacy issues before you need the data, is a good practice for scaling AI programs,” he said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A final best practice is planning of </span><b><span>physical infrastructure, </span></b><span>such as data center space. “When you are in a pilot, you need to know how much capacity you need to reserve at your data center, and how many end points you need to manage” when the application scales up, Chaudhry said, adding, “This all ties back to access to capital and all the other best practices.“</span><span> </span></p>\n",

Sonderling is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit discrimination against job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The thought that AI would become mainstream in HR departments was closer to science fiction two year ago, but the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which AI is being used by employers,” he said. “Virtual recruiting is now here to stay.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>It’s a busy time for HR professionals. “The great resignation is leading to the great rehiring, and AI will play a role in that like we have not seen before,” Sonderling said. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>AI has been employed for years in hiring—“It did not happen overnight.”—for tasks including chatting with applications, predicting whether a candidate would take the job, projecting what type of employee they would be and mapping out upskilling and reskilling opportunities. “In short, AI is now making all the decisions once made by HR personnel,” which he did not characterize as good or bad. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Carefully designed and properly used, AI has the potential to make the workplace more fair,” Sonderling said. “But carelessly implemented, AI could discriminate on a scale we have never seen before by an HR professional.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Training Datasets for AI Models Used for Hiring Need to Reflect Diversity</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This is because AI models rely on training data. If the company’s current workforce is used as the basis for training, “It will replicate the status quo. If it’s one gender or one race primarily, it will replicate that,” he said. Conversely, AI can help mitigate risks of hiring bias by race, ethnic background, or disability status. “I want to see AI improve on workplace discrimination,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Amazon began building a hiring application in 2014, and found over time that it discriminated against women in its recommendations, because the AI model was trained on a dataset of the company’s own hiring record for the previous 10 years, which was primarily of males. Amazon developers tried to correct it but ultimately scrapped the system in 2017. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Facebook has recently agreed to pay $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the US government that the social media company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules, according to an account from </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/facebook-pay-up-1425-mln-settle-us-employment-discrimination-claims-2021-10-19/\"><span>Reuters</span></a><span>. The case centered on Facebook’s use of what it called its PERM program for labor certification. The government found that Facebook refused to hire American workers for jobs that had been reserved for temporary visa holders under the PERM program. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Excluding people from the hiring pool is a violation,” Sonderling said.  If the AI program “withholds the existence of the job opportunity to that class, so they cannot exercise their rights, or if it downgrades a protected class, it is within our domain,” he said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Employment assessments, which became more common after World War II, have provided  high value to HR managers and with help from AI they have the potential to minimize bias in hiring. “At the same time, they are vulnerable to claims of discrimination, so employers need to be careful and cannot take a hands-off approach,” Sonderling said. “Inaccurate data will amplify bias in decision-making. Employers must be vigilant against discriminatory outcomes.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He recommended researching solutions from vendors who vet data for risks of bias on the basis of race, sex, and other factors. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One example is from </span><a href=\"https://www.hirevue.com/\"><span>HireVue </span></a><span>of South Jordan, Utah, which has built a hiring platform predicated on the US Equal Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, designed specifically to mitigate unfair hiring practices, according to an account from </span><a href=\"https://allwork.space/2021/10/ai-streamlines-the-hiring-process-for-many-companies-but-is-that-a-good-thing/\"><span>allWork</span></a><span>. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A post on AI ethical principles on its website states in part, “Because HireVue uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or propagation of bias against any group or individual. We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible. We also continue to advance our abilities to monitor, detect, and mitigate bias. We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Also, “Our data scientists and IO psychologists build HireVue Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment’s predictive accuracy. The result is a highly valid, bias-mitigated assessment that helps to enhance human decision making while actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>He added, “They often need to leverage open-source datasets, but many of these were trained using computer programmer volunteers, which is a predominantly white population. Because algorithms are often trained on single-origin data samples with limited diversity, when applied in real-world scenarios to a broader population of different races, genders, ages, and more, tech that appeared highly accurate in research may prove unreliable.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Also, “There needs to be an element of governance and peer review for all algorithms, as even the most solid and tested algorithm is bound to have unexpected results arise.

            "<p><span>Rolls-Royce built an Intelligent Engine platform to monitor engine flight, gathering data on weather conditions and how pilots are flying. Machine learning is applied to the data to customize maintenance regimes for individual engines.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21155\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21155\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-29StuartHughes-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21155\">Stuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer, Rolls-Royce</figcaption></figure>\n",
            "<p><span>“We’re tailoring our maintenance regimes to make sure that we’re optimizing for the life an engine has, not the life the manual says it should have,” stated Stuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer at Rolls-Royce. “It’s truly variable service, looking at each engine as an individual engine.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Customers are seeing less service interruption. “Rolls-Royce has been monitoring engines and charging per hour for at least 20 years,” Hughes stated. “That part of the business isn’t new. But as we’ve evolved, we’ve begun to treat the engine as a singular engine. It’s much more about the personalization of that engine.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Predictive analytics is being applied in healthcare as well as in the manufacturing industry. Kaiser Permanente, the integrated managed care consortium based in Oakland, Calif. Is using predictive analytics to identify non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients at risk of rapid deterioration. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>While non-ICU patients that require unexpected transfers to the ICU constitute less than 4% of the total hospital population, they account for 20% of all hospital deaths, according to Dr. Gabriel Escobar, research scientist, Division of Research, and regional director, Hospital Operations Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Kaiser Permanente Practicing Predictive Maintenance in Healthcare</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Kaiser Permanente developed the Advanced Alert Monitor (AAM) system, leveraging three predictive analytic models to analyze more than 70 factors in a given patient’s electronic health record to generate a composite risk score.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The AAM system synthesizes and analyzes vital statistics, lab results, and other variables to generate hourly deterioration risk scores for adult hospital patients in the medical-surgical and transitional care units,” stated Dick Daniels, executive vice president and CIO of Kaiser Permanente in the CIO account. “Remote hospital teams evaluate the risk scores every hour and notify rapid response teams in the hospital when potential deterioration is detected. The rapid response team conducts bedside evaluation of the patient and calibrates the course treatment with the hospitalist.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In advice to other practitioners, Daniels recommended a focus on how the tool will be fit into the workflow of health care teams. “It took us about five years to perform the initial mapping of the electronic medical record backend and develop the predictive models,” Daniels stated. “It then took us another two to three years to transition these models into a live web services application that could be used operationally.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In an example from the food industry, a PepsiCo Frito-Lay plant in Fayetteville, Tenn. is using predictive maintenance successfully, with year-to-date equipment downtime at 0.75% and unplanned downtime at 2.88%, according to Carlos Calloway, the site’s reliability engineering manager, in an account in </span><a href=\"https://www.plantservices.com/articles/2021/push-the-needle-how-6-companies-are-achieving-predictive-maintenance-success/\"><span>PlantServices</span></a><span>.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Examples of monitoring include: vibration readings confirmed by ultrasound helped to prevent a PC combustion blower motor from failing and shutting down the whole potato chip department; infrared analysis of the main pole for the plant’s GES automated warehouse detected a hot fuse holder, which helped to avoid a shutdown of the entire warehouse; and increased acid levels were detected in oil samples from a baked extruder gearbox, indicating oil degradation, which enabled prevention of a shutdown of Cheetos Puffs production.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The Frito-Lay plant produces more than 150 million pounds of product per year, including Lays, Ruffles, Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos, and Tostitos.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The types of monitoring include vibration analysis, used on mechanical applications, which is processed with the help of a third-party company which sends alerts to the plant for investigation and resolution. Another service partner performs quarterly vibration monitoring on selected equipment. All motor control center rooms and electrical panels are monitored with quarterly infrared analysis, which is also used on electrical equipment, some rotating equipment, and heat exchangers. In addition, the plant has done ultrasonic monitoring for more than 15 years, and it is “kind of like the pride and joy of our site from a predictive standpoint,” stated Calloway.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The plan has a number of products in place from UE Systems of Elmsford, NY, supplier of ultrasonic instruments, hardware and software, and training for predictive maintenance. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Louisiana Alumina Plant Automating Bearing Maintenance </span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Bearings, which wear over time under varying conditions of weather and temperature in the case of automobiles, are a leading candidate for IoT monitoring and predictive maintenance with AI. The </span><a href=\"http://www.newdayal.com/noranda-alumina\"><span>Noranda Alumina</span></a><span> plant in Gramercy, La. is finding a big payoff from its investment in a system to improve the lubrication of bearings in its production equipment. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The system has resulted in a 60% decline in bearing changes in the second year of using the new lubrication system, translating to some $900,000 in savings on bearings that did not need to be replaced and avoided downtime. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Four hours of downtime is about $1 million dollars’ worth of lost production,” stated Russell Goodwin, a reliability engineer and millwright instructor at Noranda Alumina, in the PlantServices account, which was based on presentations at the Leading Reliability 2021 event.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The Noranda Alumina plant is the only alumina plant operating in the US. “If we shut down, you’ll need to import it,” stated Goodwin. The plant experiences pervasive dust, dirt, and caustic substances, which complicate efforts at improved reliability and maintenance practices.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Noranda Alumina tracks all motors and gearboxes at 1,500 rpm and higher with vibration readings, and most below 1,500 with ultrasound. Ultrasonic monitoring, of sound in ranges beyond human hearing, was introduced to the plant after Goodwin joined the company in 2019. At the time, grease monitoring had room for improvement. “If grease was not visibly coming out of the seal, the mechanical supervisor did not count the round as complete,” stated Goodwin.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>After introducing automation, the greasing system has improved dramatically, he stated. The system was also able to detect bearings in a belt whose bearings were wearing out too quickly due to contamination. “Tool-enabled tracking helped to prove that it wasn’t improper greasing, but rather the bearing was made improperly,” stated Goodwin.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Go is a popular board game in the same complexity category as chess. Arguments are made about which is tougher, chess or Go, but I’m not going to get mired into that morass. For the sake of civil discussion, the key point is that Go is highly complex and requires intense mental concentration especially at the tournament level.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Generally, Go consists of trying to capture territory on a standard Go board, consisting of a 19 by 19 grid of intersecting lines. For those of you that have never tried playing Go, the closest similar kind of game might be the connect-the-dots that you played in childhood, which involves grabbing up territory, though Go is magnitudes more involved. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>A famous Go competition took place about four years ago that pitted one of the world’s top professional Go players, Lee Sedol, against an AI program that had been crafted to play Go, coined as AlphaGo. There is a riveting documentary about the contest and plenty of write-ups and online videos that have in detail covered the match, including post-game analysis.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Put yourself back in time to 2016 and relive what happened.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Most AI developers did not anticipate that the AI of that time would be proficient enough to beat a top Go player. Sure, AI had already been able to best some top chess players, and thus offered a glimmer of expectation that Go would eventually be equally undertaken, but there weren’t any Go programs that had been able to compete at the pinnacle levels of human Go players. Most expected that it would probably be around the year 2020 or so before the capabilities of AI would be sufficient to compete in world-class Go tournaments.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>DeepMind Created AlphaGo Using Deep Learning, Machine Learning</span></b><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A small-sized tech company named DeepMind Technologies devised the AlphaGo AI playing system (the firm was later acquired by Google). Using techniques from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the AlphaGo program was being revamped and adjusted right up to the actual tournament, a typical kind of last-ditch developer contortions that many of us have done when trying to get the last bit of added edge into something that is about to be demonstrated.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This was a monumental competition that had garnered global interest.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Human players of Go were doubtful that the AlphaGo program would win. Many AI techies were doubtful that AlphaGo would win. Even the AlphaGo developers were unsure of how well the program would do, including the stay-awake-at-night fears that the AlphaGo program would hit a bug or go into a kind of delusional mode and make outright mistakes and play foolishly.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A million dollars in prize money was put into the pot for the competition. There would be five Go games played, one per day, along with associated rules about taking breaks, etc. Some predicted that Sedol would handily win all five games, doing so without cracking a sweat. AI pundits were clinging to the hope that AlphaGo would win at least one of the five games, and otherwise, present itself as a respectable level of Go player throughout the contest.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In the first match, AlphaGo won.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This was pretty much a worldwide shocker. Sedol was taken aback. Lots of Go players were surprised that a computer program could compete and beat someone at Sedol’s level of play. Everyone began to give some street cred to the AlphaGo program and the efforts by the AI developers.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Tension grew for the next match.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For the second game, it was anticipated that Sedol might significantly change his approach to the contest. Perhaps he had been overconfident coming into the competition, some harshly asserted, and the loss of the first game would awaken him to the importance of putting all his concentration into the tournament. Or, possibly he had played as though he was competing with a lesser capable player and thus was not pulling out all the stops to try and win the match.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>What happened in the second game?</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Turns out that AlphaGo prevailed, again, and also did something that was seemingly remarkable for those that avidly play Go. On the 37</span><span>th</span><span> move of the match, the AlphaGo program opted to make placement onto the Go board in a spot that nobody especially anticipated. It was a surprise move, coming partway through a match that otherwise was relatively conventional in the nature of the moves being made by both Sedol and AlphaGo.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>At the time, in real-time, rampant speculation was that the move was an utter gaffe on the part of the AlphaGo program.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Instead, it became famous as a novel move, known now as “Move 37” and heralded in Go and used colloquially overall to suggest any instance when AI does something of a novel or unexpected manner.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In the third match, AlphaGo won again, now having successfully beaten Sedol in a 3-out-of-5 winner competition. They continued though to play a fourth and a fifth game.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>During the fourth game, things were tight as usual and the match play was going head-to-head (well, head versus AI). Put yourself into the shoes of Sedol. In one sense, he wasn’t just a Go player, he was somehow representing all of humanity (an unfair and misguided viewpoint, but pervasive anyway), and the pressure was on him to win at least one game. Just even one game would be something to hang your hat on, and bolster faith in mankind (again, a nonsensical way to look at it).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>At the seventy-eighth move of the fourth game, Sedol made a so-called “wedge” play that was not conventional and surprised onlookers. The next move by AlphaGo was rotten and diminished the likelihood of a win by the AI system. After additional play, ultimately AlphaGo tossed in the towel and resigned from the match, thus Sedol finally had a win against the AI in his belt. He ended-up losing the fifth game, so AlphaGo won four games, Sedol won one). His move also became famous, generally known as “Move 78” in the lore of Go playing.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Something else that is worthwhile to know about involves the overarching strategy that AlphaGo was crafted to utilize.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>When you play a game, let’s say connect-the-dots, you can aim to grab as many squares at each moment of play, doing so under the belief that inevitably you will then win by the accumulation of those tactically-oriented successes. Human players of Go are often apt to play that way, as it can be said too of chess players, and nearly any kind of game playing altogether.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another approach involves playing to win, even if only by the thinnest of margins, as long as you win. In that case, you might not be motivated for each tactical move to gain near-term territory or score immediate points, and be willing instead to play a larger scope game per se. The proverbial mantra is that if you are shortsighted, you might win some of the battles, but could eventually lose the war. Therefore, it might be a better strategy to keep your eye on the prize, winning the war, albeit if it means that there are battles and skirmishes to be lost along the way.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The AI developers devised AlphaGo with that kind of macro-perspective underlying how the AI system functioned.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Humans can have an especially hard time choosing at the moment to make a move that might look bad or ill-advised, such as giving up territory, finding themselves to be unable to grit their teeth, and taking a lump or two during play. The embarrassment at the instant is difficult to offset by betting that it is going to ultimately be okay, and you will prevail in the end.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For an AI system, there is no semblance of that kind of sentiment involved, and it is all about calculated odds and probabilities.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Now that we’ve covered the legendary Go match, let’s consider some lessons learned about novelty.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The “Move 38” made by the AI system was not magical. It was an interesting move, for sure, and the AI developers later indicated that the move was one that the AI had calculated would rarely be undertaken by a human player.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This can be interpreted in two ways (at least).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One interpretation is that a human player would not make that move because humans are right and know that it would be a lousy move.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another interpretation is that humans would not make that move due to a belief that the move is unwise, but this could be a result of the humans insufficiently assessing the ultimate value of the move, in the long-run, and getting caught up in a shorter time frame semblance of play.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In this instance, it turned out to be a good move—maybe a brilliant move—and turned the course of the game to the advantage of the AI. Thus, what looked like brilliance was in fact a calculated move that few humans would have imagined as valuable and for which jostled humans to rethink how they think about such matters.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Some useful recap lessons:</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Showcasing Human Self-Limited Insight.</span></b><span> When the AI does something seemingly novel, it might be viewed as novel simply because humans have already predetermined what is customary and anything beyond that is blunted by the assumption that it is unworthy or mistaken.

            "<p><b><span>Humans Exploiting AI For Added Insight</span></b><span>. Humans can gainfully assess an AI-powered novelty to potentially re-calibrate human thinking on a given topic, enlarging our understanding via leveraging something that the AI, via its vast calculative capacity, might detect or spot that we have not yet so ascertained. Thus, besides admiring the novelty, we ought to seek to improve our mental prowess by whatever source shines brightly including an AI system.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>AI Novelty Is A Dual-Edged Sword.</span></b><span> We need to be mindful of all AI systems and their possibility of acting in a novel way, which could be good or could be bad.

            "<p><span>Turning back to the topic of novelty, let’s ponder a specific use case.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A few years ago, I was driving on an open highway, going at the prevailing speed of around 65 miles per hour, and something nearly unimaginable occurred. A car coming toward me in the opposing lane, and likely traveling at around 60 to 70 miles per hour, suddenly and unexpectedly veered into my lane. It was one of those moments that you cannot anticipate.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There did not appear to be any reason for the other driver to be headed toward me, in my lane of traffic, and coming at me for an imminent and bone-chillingly terrifying head-on collision. If there had been debris on the other lane, it might have been a clue that perhaps this other driver was simply trying to swing around the obstruction. No debris. If there was a slower moving car, the driver might have wanted to do a fast end-around to get past it. Nope, there was absolutely no discernible basis for this radical and life-threatening maneuver.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>What would you do?</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Come on, hurry, the clock is ticking, and you have just a handful of split seconds to make a life-or-death driving decision.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You could stay in your lane and hope that the other driver realizes the error of their ways, opting to veer back into their lane at the last moment. Or, you could proactively go into the opposing lane, giving the other driver a clear path in your lane, but this could be a chancy game of chicken whereby the other driver chooses to go back into their lane (plus, there was other traffic further behind that driver, so going into the opposing lane was quite dicey).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Okay, so do you stay in your lane or veer away into the opposing lane?</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>I dare say that most people would be torn between those two options. Neither one is palatable.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Suppose the AI of a self-driving car was faced with the same circumstance.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>What would the AI do?</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The odds are that even if the AI had been fed with thousands upon thousands of miles of driving via a database about human driving while undergoing the ML/DL training, there might not be any instances of a head-to-head nature and thus no prior pattern to utilize for making this onerous decision.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Anyway, here’s a twist.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Imagine that the AI calculated the probabilities involving which way to go, and in some computational manner came to the conclusion that the self-driving car should go into the ditch that was at the right of the roadway. This was intended to avoid entirely a collision with the other car (the AI estimated that a head-on collision would be near-certain death for the occupants). The AI estimated that going into the ditch at such high speed would indisputably wreck the car and cause great bodily injury to the occupants, but the odds of assured death were (let’s say) calculated as lower than the head-on option possibilities (this is a variant of the infamous Trolley Problem, as covered in my columns).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>I’m betting that you would concede that most humans would be relatively unwilling to aim purposely into that ditch, which they know for sure is going to be a wreck and potential death, while instead willing (reluctantly) to take a hoped-for chance of either veering into the other lane or staying on course and wishing for the best.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In some sense, the AI might seem to have made a novel choice. It is one that (we’ll assume) few humans would have given any explicit thought toward.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Returning to the earlier recap of the points about AI novelty, you could suggest that in this example, the AI has exceeded a human self-imposed limitation by the AI having considered otherwise “unthinkable” options. From this, perhaps we can learn to broaden our view for options that otherwise don’t seem apparent.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The other recap element was that the AI novelty can be a dual-edged sword.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>If the AI did react by driving into the ditch, and you were inside the self-driving car, and you got badly injured, would you later believe that the AI acted in a novel manner or that it acted mistakenly or adversely?</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Some might say that if you lived to ask that question, apparently the AI made the right choice. The counter-argument is that if the AI had gone with one of the other choices, perhaps you would have sailed right past the other car and not gotten a single scratch.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Engineers tend to see things in unambiguous terms, which some may call Black and White terms, such as a choice between right or wrong and good and bad. The consideration of ethics in AI is highly nuanced, with vast gray areas, making it  challenging for AI software engineers to apply it in their work.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That was a takeaway from a session on the Future of Standards and Ethical AI at the </span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government</span></a><span> conference held in-person and virtually in Alexandria, Va. this week. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>An overall impression from the conference is that the discussion of AI and ethics is happening in virtually every quarter of AI in the vast enterprise of the federal government, and the consistency of points being made across all these different and independent efforts stood out.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“We engineers often think of ethics as a fuzzy thing that no one has really explained,” stated Beth-Anne Schuelke-Leech, an associate professor, Engineering Management and Entrepreneurship at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, speaking at the Future of Ethical AI session. “It can be difficult for engineers looking for solid constraints to be told to be ethical. That becomes really complicated because we don’t know what it really means.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Schuelke-Leech started her career as an engineer, then decided to pursue a PhD in public policy, a background which enables her to see things as an engineer and as a social scientist. “I got a PhD in social science, and have been pulled back into the engineering world where I am involved in AI projects, but based in a mechanical engineering faculty,” she said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>An engineering project has a goal, which describes the purpose, a set of needed features and functions, and a set of constraints, such as budget and timeline “The standards and regulations become part of the constraints,” she said. “If I know I have to comply with it, I will do that. But if you tell me it’s a good thing to do, I may or may not adopt that.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Schuelke-Leech also serves as chair of the IEEE Society’s Committee on the Social Implications of Technology Standards. She commented, “Voluntary compliance standards such as from the IEEE are essential from people in the industry getting together to say this is what we think we should do as an industry.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Some standards, such as around interoperability, do not have the force of law but engineers comply with them, so their systems will work. Other standards are described as good practices, but are not required to be followed. “Whether it helps me to achieve my goal or hinders me getting to the objective, is how the engineer looks at it,” she said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Sara Jordan, senior counsel with the Future of Privacy Forum, in the session with Schuelke-Leech, works on the ethical challenges of AI and machine learning and is an active member of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics and Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. “Ethics is messy and difficult, and is context-laden. We have a proliferation of theories, frameworks and constructs,” she said, adding, “The practice of ethical AI will require repeatable, rigorous thinking in context.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Schuelke-Leech offered, “Ethics is not an end outcome. It is the process being followed. But I’m also looking for someone to tell me what I need to do to do my job, to tell me how to be ethical, what rules I’m supposed to follow, to take away the ambiguity.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Engineers shut down when you get into funny words that they don’t understand, like ‘ontological,’ They’ve been taking math and science since they were 13-years-old,” she said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>She has found it difficult to get engineers involved in attempts to draft standards for ethical AI. “Engineers are missing from the table,” she said. “The debates about whether we can get to 100% ethical are conversations engineers do not have.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>She concluded, “If their managers tell them to figure it out, they will do so. We need to help the engineers cross the bridge halfway. It is essential that social scientists and engineers don’t give up on this.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Leader’s Panel Described Integration of Ethics into AI Development Practices</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The topic of ethics in AI is coming up more in the curriculum of the US Naval War College of Newport, R.I., which was established to provide advanced study for US Navy officers and now educates leaders from all services. Ross Coffey, a military professor of National Security Affairs at the institution, participated in a Leader&#8217;s Panel on AI, Ethics and Smart Policy at AI World Government. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The ethical literacy of students increases over time as they are working with these ethical issues, which is why it is an urgent matter because it will take a long time,” Coffey said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Panel member Carole Smith, a senior research scientist with Carnegie Mellon University who studies human-machine interaction, has been involved in integrating ethics into AI systems development since 2015. She cited the importance of “demystifying” AI.  </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“My interest is in understanding what kind of interactions we can create where the human is appropriately trusting the system they are working with, not over- or under-trusting it,” she said, adding, “In general, people have higher expectations than they should for the systems.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>As an example, she cited the Tesla Autopilot features, which implement self-driving car capability to a degree but not completely. “People assume the system can do a much broader set of activities than it was designed to do. Helping people understand the limitations of a system is important. Everyone needs to understand the expected outcomes of a system and what some of the mitigating circumstances might be,” she said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Panel member Taka Ariga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, sees a gap in AI literacy for the young workforce coming into the federal government.  “Data scientist training does not always include ethics. Accountable AI is a laudable construct, but I’m not sure everyone buys into it. We need their responsibility to go beyond technical aspects and be accountable to the end user we are trying to serve,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Panel moderator Alison Brooks, PhD, research VP of Smart Cities and Communities at the IDC market research firm, asked whether principles of ethical AI can be shared across the boundaries of nations. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“We will have a limited ability for every nation to align on the same exact approach, but we will have to align in some ways on what we will not allow AI to do, and what people will also be responsible for,” stated Smith of CMU. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The panelists credited the European Commission for being out front on these issues of ethics, especially in the enforcement realm.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Ross of the Naval War Colleges acknowledged the importance of finding common ground around AI ethics. “From a military perspective, our interoperability needs to go to a whole new level. We need to find common ground with our partners and our allies on what we will allow AI to do and what we will not allow AI to do.” Unfortunately, “I don’t know if that discussion is happening,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Discussion on AI ethics could perhaps be pursued as part of certain existing treaties, Smith suggested</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The many AI ethics principles, frameworks, and road maps being offered in many federal agencies can be challenging to follow and be made consistent. Take said, “I am hopeful that over the next year or two, we will see a coalescing.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>AI is more accessible to young people in the workforce who grew up as ‘digital natives’ with Alexa and self-driving cars as part of the landscape, giving them expectations grounded in their experience of what is possible.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That idea set the foundation for a panel discussion at </span><a href=\"https://www.aiworldgov.com/\"><span>AI World Government</span></a><span> on Mindset Needs and Skill Set Myths for AI engineering teams, held this week virtually and in-person in Alexandria, Va.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“People feel that AI is within their grasp because the technology is available, but the technology is ahead of our cultural maturity,” said panel member Dorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer for the National Science Foundation. “It’s like giving a sharp object to a child. We might have access to big data, but it might not be the right thing to do,” to work with it in all cases. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Things are accelerating, which is raising expectations. When panel member Vivek Rao, lecturer and researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, was working on his PhD, a paper on natural language processing might be a master’s thesis. “Now we assign it as a homework assignment with a two-day turnaround. We have an enormous amount of compute power that was not available even two years ago,” he said of his students, who he described as “digital natives” with high expectations of what AI makes possible.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Panel moderator Rachel Dzombak, digital transformation lead at the </span><a href=\"https://www.sei.cmu.edu/\"><span>Software Engineering Institute </span></a><span>of Carnegie Mellon University, asked the panelists what is unique about working on AI in the government. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Aronson said the government cannot get too far ahead with the technology, or the users will not know how to interact with it. “We’re not building iPhones,” she said. “We have experimentation going on, and we are always looking ahead, anticipating the future, so we can make the most cost-effective decisions. In the government right now, we are seeing the convergence of the emerging generation and the close-to-retiring generation, who we also have to serve.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Early in her career, Aronson did not want to work in the government. “I thought it meant you were either in the armed services or the Peace Corps,” she said. “But what I learned after a while is what motivates federal employees is service to larger, problem-solving institutions. We are trying to solve really big problems of equity and diversity, and getting food to people and keeping people safe. People that work for the government are dedicated to those missions.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>She referred to her two children in their 20s, who like the idea of service, but in “tiny chunks,” meaning, “They don’t look at the government as a place where they have freedom, and they can do whatever they want. They see it as a lockdown situation. But it’s really not.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Berkeley Students Learn About Role of Government in Disaster Response </span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Rao of Berkeley said his students are seeing wildfires in California and asking who is working on the challenge of doing something about them. When he tells them it is almost always local, state and federal government entities, “Students are generally surprised to find that out.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In one example, he developed a course on innovation in disaster response, in collaboration with CMU and the Department of Defense, the Army Futures Lab and Coast Guard search and rescue. “This was eye-opening for students,” he said. At the outset, two of 35 students expressed interest in a federal government career. By the end of the course, 10 of the 35 students were expressing interest. One of them was hired by the Naval Surface Warfare Center outside Corona, Calif. as a software engineer, Rao said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Aronson described the process of bringing on new federal employees as a “heavy lift,” suggesting, “if we could prepare in advance, it would move a lot faster.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21140\" style=\"width: 188px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-21140\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22BryanLane-2-188x300.jpeg\" width=\"188\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21140\">Bryan Lane, director of Data &amp; AI, General Services Administration</figcaption></figure>\n",
            "<p><span>Asked by Dzombak what skill sets and mindsets are seen as essential to AI engineering teams, panel member Bryan Lane, director of Data &amp; AI at the General Services Administration (who announced during the session that he is taking on a new role at FDIC), said resiliency is a necessary quality. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lane is a technology executive within the GSA IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoE) with over 15 years of experience leading advanced analytics and technology initiatives. He has led the GSA partnership with the DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). </span><i><span>[Ed. Note: Known as “the Jake.”] </span></i><span>Lane also is the founder of </span><a href=\"https://www.dataxd.io/\"><span>DATA XD.</span></a><span> He also has experience in industry, managing acquisition portfolios. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The most important thing about resilient teams going on an AI journey is that you need to be ready for the unexpected, and the mission persists,” he said. “If you are all aligned on the importance of the mission, the team can be held together.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Good Sign that Team Members Acknowledge Having “Never Done This Before”</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Regarding mindset, he said more of his team members are coming to him and saying, “I’ve never done this before.” He sees that as a good sign that offers an opportunity to talk about risk and alternative solutions. “When your team has the psychological safety to say that they don’t know something,” Lane sees it as positive. “The focus is always on what you have done and what you have delivered. Rarely is the focus on what you have not done before and what you want to grow into,” he said,</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Aronson has found it challenging to get AI projects off the ground. “It’s hard to tell management that you have a use case or problem to solve and want to go at it, and there is a 50-50 chance it will get done, and you don’t know how much it’s going to cost,” she said. “It comes down to articulating the rationale and convincing others it’s the right thing to do to move forward.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Rao said he talks to students about experimentation and having an experimental mindset. “AI tools can be easily accessible, but they can mask the challenges you can encounter. When you apply the vision API, for example in the context of challenges in your business or government agency, things may not be smooth,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Moderator Dzombak asked the panelists how they build teams. Arson said, “You need a mix of people.” She has tried “communities of practice” around solving specific problems, where people can come and go. “You bring people together around a problem and not a tool,” she said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lane seconded this. “I really have stopped focusing on tools in general,” he said. He ran experiments at JAIC in accounting, finance and other areas. “We found it’s not really about the tools. It’s about getting the right people together to understand the problems, then looking at the tools available,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lane said he sets up “cross-functional teams” that are “a little more formal than a community of interest.” He has found them to be effective for working together on a problem for maybe 45 days. He also likes working with customers of the needed services inside the organization, and has seen customers learn about data management and AI as a result. “We will pick up one or two along the way who become advocates for accelerating AI throughout the organization,” Lane said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lane sees it taking five years to work out proven methods of thinking, working, and best practices for developing AI systems to serve the government. He mentioned </span><a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov/\"><span>The Opportunity Project</span></a><span> (TOP) of the US Census Bureau, begun in 2016 to work on challenges such as ocean plastic pollution, COVID-19 economic recovery and disaster response. TOP has engaged in over 135 public-facing projects in that time, and has over 1,300 alumni including developers, designers, community leaders, data and policy experts, students and government agencies. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“It’s based on a way of thinking and how to organize work,” Lane said. “We have to scale the model of delivery, but five years from now, we will have enough proof of concept to know what works and what does not.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Ariga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, discussed an</span><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-519sp\"><span> AI Accountability Framework</span></a><span> he helped to develop by convening a forum of experts in the government, industry, nonprofits, as well as federal inspector general officials and AI experts. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“We are adopting an auditor’s perspective on the AI accountability framework,” Ariga said. “GAO is in the business of verification.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The effort to produce a formal framework began in September 2020 and included 60% women, 40% of whom were underrepresented minorities, to discuss over two days. The effort was spurred by a desire to ground the AI accountability framework in the reality of an engineer’s day-to-day work. The resulting framework was first published in June as what Ariga described as “version 1.0.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Seeking to Bring a “High-Altitude Posture” Down to Earth</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“We found the AI accountability framework had a very high-altitude posture,” Ariga said. “These are laudable ideals and aspirations, but what do they mean to the day-to-day AI practitioner? There is a gap, while we see AI proliferating across the government.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“We landed on a lifecycle approach,” which steps through stages of design, development, deployment and continuous monitoring. The development effort stands on four “pillars” of Governance, Data, Monitoring and Performance. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Governance reviews what the organization has put in place to oversee the AI efforts. “The chief AI officer might be in place, but what does it mean? Can the person make changes? Is it multidisciplinary?”  At a system level within this pillar, the team will review individual AI models to see if they were “purposely deliberated.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For the Data pillar, his team will examine how the training data was evaluated, how representative it is, and is it functioning as intended.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For the Performance pillar, the team will consider the “societal impact” the AI system will have in deployment, including whether it risks a violation of the Civil Rights Act. “Auditors have a long-standing track record of evaluating equity. We grounded the evaluation of AI to a proven system,” Ariga said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring, he said, “AI is not a technology you deploy and forget.” he said. “We are preparing to continually monitor for model drift and the fragility of algorithms, and we are scaling the AI appropriately.” The evaluations will determine whether the AI system continues to meet the need “or whether a sunset is more appropriate,” Ariga said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He is part of the discussion with NIST on an overall government AI accountability framework. “We don’t want an ecosystem of confusion,” Ariga said. “We want a whole-government approach. We feel that this is a useful first step in pushing high-level ideas down to an altitude meaningful to the practitioners of AI.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>DIU Assesses Whether Proposed Projects Meet Ethical AI Guidelines</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21134\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21134\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22BryceGoodman-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21134\">Bryce Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning, the Defense Innovation Unit</figcaption></figure>\n",
            "<p><span>At the DIU, Goodman is involved in a similar effort to develop guidelines for developers of AI projects within the government. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Projects Goodman has been involved with implementation of AI for humanitarian assistance and disaster response, predictive maintenance, to counter-disinformation, and predictive health. He heads the Responsible AI Working Group. He is a faculty member of Singularity University, has a wide range of consulting clients from inside and outside the government, and holds a PhD in AI and Philosophy from the University of Oxford.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The DOD in February 2020 adopted five areas of </span><a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2091996/dod-adopts-ethical-principles-for-artificial-intelligence/\"><span>Ethical Principles for AI</span></a><span> after 15 months of consulting with AI experts in commercial industry, government academia and the American public.  These areas are: Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable and Governable. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Those are well-conceived, but it’s not obvious to an engineer how to translate them into a specific project requirement,” Good said in a presentation on Responsible AI Guidelines at the AI World Government event. “That’s the gap we are trying to fill.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Before the DIU even considers a project, they run through the ethical principles to see if it passes muster. Not all projects do. “There needs to be an option to say the technology is not there or the problem is not compatible with AI,” he said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>All project stakeholders, including from commercial vendors and within the government, need to be able to test and validate and go beyond minimum legal requirements to meet the principles. “The law is not moving as fast as AI, which is why these principles are important,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Also, collaboration is going on across the government to ensure values are being preserved and maintained. “Our intention with these guidelines is not to try to achieve perfection, but to avoid catastrophic consequences,” Goodman said. “It can be difficult to get a group to agree on what the best outcome is, but it’s easier to get the group to agree on what the worst-case outcome is.” </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The DIU guidelines along with case studies and supplemental materials will be published on the DIU website “soon,” Goodman said, to help others leverage the experience.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Here are Questions DIU Asks Before Development Starts</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The first step in the guidelines is to define the task.  “That&#8217;s the single most important question,” he said. “Only if there is an advantage, should you use AI.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Next is a benchmark, which needs to be set up front to know if the project has delivered. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Next, he evaluates ownership of the candidate data. “Data is critical to the AI system and is the place where a lot of problems can exist.” Goodman said. “We need a certain contract on who owns the data. If ambiguous, this can lead to problems.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Next, Goodman’s team wants a sample of data to evaluate. Then, they need to know how and why the information was collected. “If consent was given for one purpose, we cannot use it for another purpose without re-obtaining consent,” he said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Next, the team asks if the responsible stakeholders are identified, such as pilots who could be affected if a component fails. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Next, the responsible mission-holders must be identified. “We need a single individual for this,” Goodman said. “Often we have a tradeoff between the performance of an algorithm and its explainability. We might have to decide between the two. Those kinds of decisions have an ethical component and an operational component. So we need to have someone who is accountable for those decisions, which is consistent with the chain of command in the DOD.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Finally, the DIU team requires a process for rolling back if things go wrong. “We need to be cautious about abandoning the previous system,” he said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Once all these questions are answered in a satisfactory way, the team moves on to the development phase.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In lessons learned, Goodman said, “Metrics are key. And simply measuring accuracy might not be adequate. We need to be able to measure success.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Also, fit the technology to the task. “High risk applications require low-risk technology. And when potential harm is significant, we need to have high confidence in the technology,” he said. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another lesson learned is to set expectations with commercial vendors. “We need vendors to be transparent,” he said. ”When someone says they have a proprietary algorithm they cannot tell us about, we are very wary. We view the relationship as a collaboration. It’s the only way we can ensure that the AI is developed responsibly.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Lastly, “AI is not magic. It will not solve everything. It should only be used when necessary and only when we can prove it will provide an advantage.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Advances in the AI behind speech recognition are driving growth in the market, attracting venture capital and funding startups, posing challenges to established players.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The growing acceptance and use of speech recognition devices are driving the market, which according to an estimate by Meticulous Research is expected to reach $26.8 billion globally by 2025, according to a recent account in </span><a href=\"https://www.analyticsinsight.net/voice-recognition-market-will-be-worth-26-79-billion-by-2025/\"><span>Analytics Insight</span></a><span>. Better speed and accuracy are among the benefits of the evolving technology.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_21128\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21128\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22DylanFox-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-21128\">Dylan Fox, CEO and Founder, AssemblyAI</figcaption></figure>\n",
            "<p><span>One company in the throes of this new growth, AssemblyAI of San Francisco, is offering an API for speech recognition capable of transcribing videos, podcasts, phone calls, and remote meetings. The company was founded by CEO Dylan Fox in 2017 and has received backing from Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, as well as NVIDIA. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Fox has an unusual background for a high tech entrepreneur. He is a graduate of George Washington University with a degree in business administration, business economics, and public policy. He got a job as a software engineer for machine learning in the emerging product lab of Cisco in San Francisco, working on deep neural networks and machine learning. He got the idea for AssemblyAi and attracted capital from Y Combinator, which enabled him to hire data scientists and data engineers to get the technology off the ground. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Asked in an interview with </span><i><span>AI Trends</span></i><span> how he made this transition from undergrad in business administration and economics to high-tech entrepreneur, Fox said, “I taught myself how to program, which led me to a path of machine learning. I was looking for a harder software challenge, which led to natural language processing, which took me to Cisco.” They were working on Siri for the Enterprise for Apple at the time,</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>To speed up the work, Cisco was looking to acquire speech recognition software; Fox was in the catbird’s seat for the search. “We looked at Nuance,” for example, acknowledged as a market leader and owner of more speech recognition software than its competitors. (The acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft for $19.6 billion is expected to be finalized by year-end.) The young, budding entrepreneur was not impressed. “It was crazy how bad all the options were from an accuracy and a developer point of view,” he stated.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He was impressed by Twilio, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2008, which that year released the Twilio Voice API to make and receive phone calls hosted in the cloud. The company has since raised $103 million in venture capital. “They were setting new standards for a good API for developers,” Fox said.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Fox’s idea was to use AI and machine learning to achieve “super accurate results, and make it easy for developers to incorporate the API into their products. One customer is CallRail, offering call tracking and marketing analytics software, which plans to incorporate AssembyAI’s API to gain insight into why people are calling. Other customers include NBC and the Wall Street Journal, using the product to transcribe content and interviews, and provide closed captioning. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“We’ve been working on building as close to human speech recognition quality as possible. It’s been a lot of work” Fox said. He expects to reach that plateau in 2022.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>He targets companies incorporating speech recognition into their products and makes it easy to buy. Customers pay on a usage basis; for every second of audio transcribed, AssemblyAI charges a fraction of a penny. Clients get billed monthly. If a customer uses 10 hours a month, it costs about nine dollars. If a customer uses a million hours a month, it costs about $900,000.  </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Voice recognition is a hot market. “Many new startups are being launched,” Fox said, providing opportunity. “Many interesting new businesses are being built on voice data.” </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>AssemblyAI’s product can detect sensitive topics such as hate speech and profanity, so customers can save on human content moderation.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Asked to describe what differentiates his technology, Fox said, “We are an experienced team of deep learning researchers,” with experience from companies including BMW, Apple, and Facebook. “We build very large, very accurate deep learning models that have recognition results far more accurate than a traditional machine learning approach. We build really large models using advanced neural network technologies.” He compared the approach to what OpenAI uses to develop its GPT-3 large language model. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In addition, they build AI features on top of the transcriptions, to provide summaries of audio and video content, which can be searched and indexed. “It goes beyond just transcription,” Fox said. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The company currently has 25 employees and expects to double in about four months. Business has been good. “There is an explosion of audio and video data online and customers want to be able to take advantage of it, so we see a lot of demand,” Fox said.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"70\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10-22ForbiddenKnowledge-2-100x70.jpeg\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 5px;\" width=\"100\" /><p><i><span>By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider</span></i><span> </span><span>  </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Are there things that we must not know? </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This is an age-old question. Some assert that there is the potential for knowledge that ought to not be known. In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall. The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous. It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming. The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>It is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all. Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects. It is just plain bad. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>We are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed. This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt exemplar of the problems associated with knowledge. Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device. In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category. This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered. Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>On a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first. In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Round and round we can go.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Maybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful. Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent. Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Here’s the rub.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Suppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think. There are two major potential gotchas.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>First, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things. If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Secondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms. It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Plenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Per the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars. Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Generally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5. To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Not everyone would agree with that assumption. Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4. Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley. An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end. In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5. Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Aha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside. In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>To some, this seems farfetched.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>They would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about?</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Here’s their logic. Humans are able to drive cars. Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car. Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Seems like pretty ironclad logic.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning. With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us. When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Attempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon). Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too. It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>If you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge. On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern. The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge. Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge formulation.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall. The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous. It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming.\\xa0The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all. Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects. It is just plain bad.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed. This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt\\xa0exemplar\\xa0of the problems associated with knowledge. Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device. In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category. This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered. Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first. In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Round and round we can go.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Maybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful. Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent. Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s the rub.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think. There are two major potential gotchas.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>First, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things. If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Secondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms. It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Plenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and then exploitation of forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware that many would scoff at this allegation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes potential forbidden knowledge. The technology and technological elements are relatively ho-hum, they would argue. You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the ballpark of forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that path. Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at the next turn.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One area where AI is being actively used is to create Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We are gradually seeing the emergence of self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships, self-driving submersibles, etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Today’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent of AI-based, true self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s an intriguing question that has arisen:\\xa0</span><i><span>Might the crafting of AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?</span></i><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Before jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when referring to true self-driving cars.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Self-Driving Cars And Forbidden Knowledge</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All occupants will be passengers.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The AI is doing the driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Per the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars. Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Generally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5. To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Not everyone would agree with that assumption. Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4. Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley. An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end. In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5. Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Aha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside. In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To some, this seems\\xa0farfetched.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>They would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s their logic. Humans are able to drive cars. Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car. Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Seems like pretty ironclad logic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning. With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us. When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Attempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon). Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too. It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>If you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge. On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern. The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge. Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge formulation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Expect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Conclusion</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Wow, that’s quite a bit of pondering, contemplation, and (some would say) wild thinking.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Maybe so, but it is a consideration that some would wish that we gave at least some credence toward and devoted attention to.

              "'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAre there things that we must not know?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is an age-old question.\\xa0Some assert that there is the potential for knowledge that ought to not be known. In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall. The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous. It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming.\\xa0The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all. Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects. It is just plain bad.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed. This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.\\xa0\\nA contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt\\xa0exemplar\\xa0of the problems associated with knowledge. Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device. In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category. This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered. Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first. In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nRound and round we can go.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.\\xa0\\nThe alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful. Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent. Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s the rub.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think. There are two major potential gotchas.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things. If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.\\xa0\\nSecondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms. It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPlenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and then exploitation of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware that many would scoff at this allegation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes potential forbidden knowledge. The technology and technological elements are relatively ho-hum, they would argue. You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the ballpark of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\nFor those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that path. Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at the next turn.\\xa0\\nOne area where AI is being actively used is to create Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).\\xa0\\nWe are gradually seeing the emergence of self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships, self-driving submersibles, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nToday’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent of AI-based, true self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s an intriguing question that has arisen:\\xa0Might the crafting of AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBefore jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when referring to true self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Forbidden Knowledge\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll occupants will be passengers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars. Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGenerally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5. To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNot everyone would agree with that assumption. Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4. Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley. An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end. In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5. Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside. In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\nTo some, this seems\\xa0farfetched.\\xa0\\nThey would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s their logic. Humans are able to drive cars. Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car. Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSeems like pretty ironclad logic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning. With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us. When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAttempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon). Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too. It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge. On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern. The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge. Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge formulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWow, that’s quite a bit of pondering, contemplation, and (some would say) wild thinking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe so, but it is a consideration that some would wish that we gave at least some credence toward and devoted attention to. There is the angst that we might find ourselves by happenstance stumbling into forbidden knowledge on these voracious self-driving cars quests.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor however you might emphasize that having AI-based true self-driving cars will be a potential blessing, proffering mobility-for-all and leading to reducing the number of car crash-related fatalities, there is a sneaking suspicion that it will not be all-good. The catch or trap could be that there is some kind of forbidden knowledge that will get brought to the eye and we will inevitably kick ourselves that we didn’t see it coming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next time you are munching on a delicious apple, give some thought to whether self-driving cars might be forbidden fruit.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe are on the path to taking a big bite, and we’ll have to see where that takes us.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0\\nhttp://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0'"

Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\nPredictive maintenance (PdM)\\xa0has emerged as a killer AI app.\\xa0\\nIn the past five years, predictive maintenance has moved from a niche use case to a fast-growing, high return on investment (ROI) application that is delivering true value to users.\\xa0These developments are an indication of the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI together, a market considered in its infancy today.\\xa0\\nThese observations are from research conducted by IoT Analytics, consultants who supply market intelligence, which recently estimated that the $6.9 billion predictive maintenance market will reach $28.2 billion by 2026.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe company began its research coverage of the IoT-driven predictive maintenance market in 2016, at an industry maintenance conference in Dortmund, Germany. Not much was happening. “We were bitterly disappointed,” stated Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, in an account in\\xa0IoT Business News. “Not a single exhibitor was talking about predictive maintenance.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThings have changed. IoT Analytics analyst\\xa0Fernando Alberto\\xa0Brügge\\xa0stated,\\xa0“Our research in 2021 shows that predictive maintenance has clearly evolved from the rather static condition-monitoring approach. It has become a viable IoT application that is delivering overwhelmingly positive ROI.”\\xa0\\nTechnical developments that have contributed to the market expansion include: a simplified process for connecting IoT assets, major advances in cloud services, and improvements in the accessibility of machine learning/data science frameworks, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlong with the technical developments, the predictive maintenance market has seen a steady increase in the number of software and service providers offering solutions. IoT Analytics identified about 100 companies in the space in 2016; today the company identifies 280 related solution providers worldwide. Many of them are startups who recently entered the field. Established providers including GE, PTC, Cisco, ABB,\\xa0and Siemens, have entered the market in the past five years, many through acquisitions.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe market still has room; the analysts predict 500 companies will be in the business in the next five years.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 2016, the ROI from predictive analytics was unclear. In 2021, a survey of about 100 senior IT executives from the industrial sector found that predictive maintenance projects have delivered a positive ROI in 83%\\xa0of the cases. Some 45%\\xa0of those reported amortizing their investments in less than a year. “This data demonstrated how attractive the investment has become in recent years,” the analysts stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore IoT Sensors Means More Precision\\xa0\\nImplemented projects that the analysts studied in 2016 relied on a limited number of data sources, typically one sensor value, such as vibration or temperature. Projects described in the 2021 report described 11 classes of data sources, such as data from existing sensors or data from the controllers. As more sources are tapped, the precision of the predictions increase, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMany projects today are using hybrid modeling approaches that rely on domain expertise, virtual sensors and augmented data.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0and PARC are two suppliers identified in the report as embracing hybrid modeling approaches.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0has worked with over 60 companies to develop and test hybrid models that combine physics with ML/data science knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy.\\xa0\\nThe move to edge computing is expected to further benefit predictive modeling projects, by enabling algorithms to run at the point where data is collected, reducing response latency. The supplier STMicroelectronics recently introduced some smart sensor nodes that can gather data and do some analytic processing.\\xa0\\nMore predictive maintenance apps are being integrated with enterprise software systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance\\xa0 management systems (CMMS). Litmus Automation offers an integration service to link to any industrial asset, such as a programmable logic controller, a distributed control system, or a supervisory control and data acquisition system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nReduced Downtime Results in Savings\\xa0\\nGains come from preventing downtime.\\xa0“Predictive maintenance is the result of monitoring operational equipment and taking action to prevent potential downtime or an unexpected or negative outcome,” stated Mike Leone, an analyst at IT strategy firm Enterprise Strategy Group, in an account from\\xa0TechTarget.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFelipe Parages, Senior Data Scientist, Valkyrie\\nAdvances that have made predictive maintenance more practical today include sensor technology becoming more widespread, and the ability to monitor industrial machines in real time, stated Felipe Parages, senior data scientist at Valkyrie, data sense consultants. With more sensors, the volume of data has grown exponentially, and data analytics via cloud services has become available.\\xa0\\nIt used to be that an expert had to perform an analysis to determine if a machine was not operating in an optimal way.\\xa0“Nowadays, with the amount of data you can leverage and the new techniques based on machine learning and AI, it is possible to find patterns in all that data, things that are very subtle and would have escaped notice by a human being,” stated Parages.\\xa0\\nAs a result, one person can now monitor hundreds of machines, and companies are accumulating historical data, which enables deeper trend analysis. “Predictive maintenance “is a very powerful weapon,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn an example project, Italy’s primary rail operator, Trenitalia, adopted predictive maintenance for its high-speed trains. The system is expected to save eight to 10%\\xa0of an annual maintenance budget of 1.3 billion Euros, stated Paul Miller, an analyst with research firm Forrester, which recently issued a report on the project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“They can eliminate unplanned failures which often provide direct savings in maintenance but just as importantly, by taking a train out of service before it breaks—that\\xa0means better customer service and happier customers,” Miller stated. He recommended organizations start out with predictive maintenance by fielding a pilot project.\\xa0\\nIn an example of the types of cooperation predictive maintenance projects are expected to engender, the CEOs of several European auto and electronics firms recently announced plans to join forces to form the “Software Republique,” a new ecosystem for innovation in intelligent mobility. Atos, Dassault\\xa0Systèmes, Groupe Renault, and STMicroelectronics and Thales announced their decision to pool their expertise to accelerate the market.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer, Groupe Renault\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Renault, stated in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics,\\xa0“In the new mobility value chain, on-board intelligence systems are the new driving force, where all research and investment are now concentrated. Faced with this technological challenge, we are choosing to play collectively and openly. There will be no center of gravity, the value of each will be multiplied by others. The combined expertise in cybersecurity, microelectronics, energy and data management will enable us to develop unique, cutting-edge solutions for low-carbon, shared, and responsible mobility, made in Europe.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Software République will be based in Guyancourt, a commune in north-central France at the Renault\\xa0Technocentre\\xa0in a building called\\xa0Odyssée, a 12,000 square meter space which is eco-responsible. For example, its interior and exterior structure is 100 percent wood, and the building is covered with photovoltaic panels.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles in\\xa0IoT Business News,\\xa0\\xa0TechTarget, and\\xa0in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics.',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Editor John P. Desmond\\xa0\\xa0\\nNVIDIA\\xa0on May 6 detailed a partnership with the US Postal Service underway for over a year to speed up mail service using AI, with a goal of reducing current processing time tasks that take days to hours.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe project fields edge servers at 195 Post Services sites across the nation, which review 20 terabytes of images a day from 1,000 mail processing machines, according to a post on the\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0blog.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal, Nvidia\\n“The federal government has been for the last several years talking about the importance of artificial intelligence as a strategic imperative to our nation, and as an important funding priority. It’s been talked about in the White House, on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon. It’s been funded by billions of dollars, and it’s full of proof of concepts and pilots,” stated Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal for\\xa0NVIDIA, in an interview with\\xa0Nextgov.\\xa0\\xa0“And this is one of the few enterprise–wide examples of an artificial intelligence deployment that I think can serve to inspire the whole of the federal government.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe project started with USPS AI architect at the time Ryan Simpson, who had the idea to try to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing, into something much bigger, according to the blog post. (Simpson worked for USPS for over 12 years, and moved to\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0as a senior data scientist eight months ago.) He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0and others to design the needed deep-learning models. The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia’s EGX platform at USPS. The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge.\\xa0\\n“It used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple of hours,” stated Todd Schimmel, Manager, Letter Mail Technology, USPS. He oversees USPS systems including ECIP, which uses\\xa0NVIDIA-Certified\\xa0edge servers from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn another analysis, a computer vision task that would have required two weeks on a network of servers with 800 CPUs can now get done in 20 minutes on the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in one of the HPE Apollo 6500 servers.\\xa0\\xa0\\nContract Awarded in 2019 for System Using OCR\\xa0\\xa0\\nUSPS had put out a request for proposals for a system using optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow. “In the past, we would have bought new hardware, software—a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we’d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you’re talking about approximately a billion images,” stated Schimmel.\\xa0\\nAI algorithms were developed on these NVIDIA DGX servers at a US Postal Service Engineering facility. (Credit: Nvidia)\\nToday, the new OCR application will rely on a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration system, and served by\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0Triton, the company’s open-source inference-serving software. Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or\\xa0PyTorch.\\xa0\\nThe deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. “We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added\\xa0\\nMultiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work. The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.\\xa0\\n“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne model,\\xa0for example,\\xa0automatically checks to see if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight,\\xa0and destination. Another one that will automatically decipher a damaged barcode could be online this summer.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI.

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\nNew laws will soon shape how companies use AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe five largest federal financial regulators in the US recently released a request for information how banks use AI, signaling that new guidance is coming for the finance business. Soon after that, the US Federal Trade Commission released a set of guidelines on “truth, fairness and equity” in AI, defining the illegal use of AI as any act that “causes more harm than good,” according to a recent account in\\xa0Harvard Business Review.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd on April 21, the European Commission issued its own proposal for the regulation of AI (See\\xa0AI Trends, April 22, 2021)\\xa0\\xa0\\nAndrew Burt, Managing Partner, bnh.ai\\nWhile we don’t know\\xa0what these regulation will allow, “Three\\xa0central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of\\xa0bnh.ai, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst,\\xa0conduct assessments of AI risks. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, Virginia’s recently-passed\\xa0Consumer Data Protection Act, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms.\\xa0\\nThe EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states. The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019.\\xa0The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSecond,\\xa0accountability and independence. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThird,\\xa0continuous review. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproaches in US, Europe and China Differ\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in\\xa0The Verdict, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.\\xa0\\n“Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states. Meanwhile, “China continues to follow a government-first approach” and has been widely criticized for the use of AI technology to monitor citizens. The account noted examples in the rollout by Tencent last year of an AI-based credit scoring system to determine the “trust value” of people, and the installation of surveillance cameras outside people’s homes to monitor the quarantine imposed after the breakout of COVID-19.\\xa0\\n“Whether the US’ tech industry-led efforts, China’s government-first approach, or Europe’s privacy and regulation-driven approach is the best way forward remains to be seen,” the account stated.\\xa0\\nIn the US, many companies are aware of the risk of new AI regulation that could stifle innovation and their ability to grow in the digital economy, suggested a\\xa0recent report\\xa0from\\xa0pwc, the multinational professional services firm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s in a company’s interests to tackle risks related to data, governance, outputs, reporting, machine learning and AI models, ahead of regulation,” the\\xa0pwc\\xa0analysts state. They recommended business leaders assemble people from across the organization to oversee accountability and governance of technology, with oversight from a diverse team that includes members with business, IT and specialized AI skills.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCritics of European AI Act Cite Too Much Gray Area\\xa0\\nWhile some argue that the European Commission’s proposed AI Act\\xa0leaves too much gray area, the hope of the European Commission is that their proposed AI Act will provide guidance for businesses wanting to pursue AI, as well as a degree of legal certainty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market\\n“Trust… we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,” stated Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, in an account in\\xa0TechCrunch. AI applications “need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory — that is absolutely crucial — but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.”\\xa0\\n“What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.”\\xa0\\n“So come here—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure,” Breton suggested.\\xa0\\nAnother reaction was that the Commission’s proposal has overly broad exemptions, such as for law enforcement to use remote biometric surveillance including facial recognition technology, and it does not go far enough to address the risk of discrimination.\\xa0\\nReactions to the Commission’s proposal included plenty of criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement’s use of remote biometric surveillance (such as facial recognition tech) as well as concerns that measures in the regulation to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don’t go nearly far enough.\\xa0\\n“The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice,” stated Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for Fair Trials, the global criminal justice watchdog based in London. “The framework must include rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial. This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo accomplish this, he suggested,\\xa0“The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.”\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0in\\xa0Harvard Business Review, in\\xa0The Verdict\\xa0and in\\xa0TechCrunch.\\xa0',\n",

In addition, automated bot attacks shot upward by 100 million between July and December, targeting companies in a range of industries.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompanies striving for better protection risk making life more difficult for their customers; another study found that 40% of financial institutions frequently mistake the online actions of legitimate customers to those of fraudsters.\\xa0\\nCaleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud, Stash Financial\\n“As we look toward the post-pandemic—or, more accurately, inter-pandemic—era, we see just how good fraudsters were at using synthetic identities to defeat manual and semi-manual onboarding processes,” stated Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud at Stash Financial of New York, offering a personal finance app, in an interview with\\xa0Pymnts.\\xa0\\nSIM Sway Can Create a Synthetic Identity\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne technique for achieving a synthetic identity is a SIM swap, in which someone contacts your wireless carrier and is able to convince the call center employee that they are you, using personal data that may have been exposed in hacks, data breaches or information publicly shared on social networks, according to an account on\\xa0CNET.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce your phone number is assigned to a new card, all of your incoming calls and text messages will be routed to whatever phone the new SIM card is in.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIdentity theft losses were $712.4 billion-plus in 2020, up 42% from 2019, Callahan stated.\\xa0“To be frank, our defenses are fragmented and too dependent on technologies such as SMS [texting] that were never designed to provide secure services. Banks and all businesses should be looking at how to unify data signals and layer checkpoints in order to keep up with today’s sophisticated fraudsters,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked what tools and technologies would help differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate customers, Callahan stated, “in an ideal world, we would have a digital identity infrastructure that banks and others could depend on, but I think that we are some ways away from that right now.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nGoing forward, “The needs of the travel and hospitality, health, education and other sectors might accelerate the evolution of infrastructure for safety and security,” Callahan foresees.\\xa0\\nAI and Biometrics Seen as Offering Security Advantages\\xa0\\nAI can be employed to protect digital identity fraud, such as by offering greater accuracy and speed when it comes to verifying a person’s identity, or by incorporating biometric data so that a cybercriminal would not be able to gain access to information by only providing credentials, according to an account in\\xa0Forbes.\\xa0\\nDeepak Gupta, Cofounder and CTO,\\xa0LoginRadius\\n“AI has the power to save the world from digital identity fraud,” stated Deepak Gupta, author of the Forbes article and\\xa0cofounder\\xa0and CTO of\\xa0LoginRadius, a cloud-based consumer identity platform. “In the fight against ID theft, it is already a strong weapon.

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur lives are filled with explanations.\\xa0You go to see your primary physician due to a sore shoulder. The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.\\xa0\\nSo, you ask for an explanation.\\xa0\\nIn a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed. That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations. Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct. The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action. Period, end of story.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations. There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. Hospitals have their own in-house courses. Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThough that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue.\\xa0\\nKnowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science. You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.\\xa0\\nExplanations come in all shapes and sizes.\\xa0\\nA person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles. The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes.\\xa0\\nThe explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation. Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get. They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.\\xa0\\nPerhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do. The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.\\xa0\\nThe person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to\\xa0notice\\xa0that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe usually take\\xa0these differences\\xa0for granted.\\xa0You rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have. Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful. Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has,\\xa0in the case of a medical diagnosis,\\xa0whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet. They just want an explanation (or so they say). Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed. This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation.\\xa0\\nAll told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. This is certainly a sensible aspect. If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist. In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other.\\xa0\\nWe can add a twist on that twist.\\xa0Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one.\\xa0Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.\\xa0\\nThat’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand.\\xa0\\nAnother angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas\\xa0you\\xa0are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy all this talk about explanations?\\xa0Because of AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions. If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNote that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation.\\xa0\\nErgo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation. Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is known as Explainable AI (XAI).\\xa0\\nXAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTake as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns. Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way.\\xa0\\nThis means that the AI is\\xa0not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component. This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms.\\xa0\\nSome assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised. Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied. Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations. There is no interaction. There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.\\xa0\\nThose are the pittance explanations.\\xa0\\nA more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation. The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOf course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra. There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI. We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question is this:\\xa0In what way will Explainable AI (XAI) be important to the advent of AVs and as showcased via the emergence of self-driving cars?\\xa0\\nLet’s clarify what I mean by self-driving cars, and then we can jump further into the XAI AV discussion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And XAI\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale. There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination. No need to chat. You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s perfectly fine.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual. You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination. They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver.\\xa0\\nIt could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation. Humans do that. In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.\\xa0\\nYou might be satisfied with that explanation. On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place. Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction. In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or\\xa0facets\\xa0about the explanation that was being provided.\\xa0\\nOkay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.\\xa0A self-driving car is taking you to your home.\\xa0The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system. You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal. Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars.\\xa0\\nIn essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. This is something that won’t be especially scalable. In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri. The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes. The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action.\\xa0\\nYou would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation. If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like. There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so. You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent. This might take a few moments to engage.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars. You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes.\\xa0\\nThe point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened. The XAI might instantly explain that there was a dog on the sidewalk that was running toward the self-driving car and appeared to be getting within striking distance. The AI driving system opted to do a fast braking action. The dog got the idea and safely scampered away.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA timely explanation, and one that then gives the passenger solace and relief, allowing them to settle back into their seat and watch more of those videos about frisky kittens and adorable puppies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are lots and lots of situations that can arise when riding in a car and for which you might desire an explanation. The car is suddenly brought to a halt. The car takes a curve rather strongly. The car veers into an adjacent lane without a comfortable margin of error. The car takes a road that you weren’t expecting to be on. Seemingly endless possibilities exist.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that case, if indeed XAI is notably handy for self-driving cars, you might be wondering why it isn’t especially in place already.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWell, admittedly, for those AI developers under intense pressures to devise AI that can drive a car from point A to point B, doing so safely, the aspect of providing machine-generated explanations is pretty low on their priority list. They would fervently argue that it is a so-called edge or corner case. It can be gotten to when the sunshine of having achieved sufficiently self-driving cars has been achieved.\\xa0\\nHumans that are riding in AVs of all kinds are going to want to have explanations. A cost-effective and immediately available means of providing explanations entails the embodiment of XAI into the AI systems that are doing the autonomous piloting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne supposes that if you are inside a self-driving car and it is urgently doing some acrobatic driving maneuver, you might be hesitant to ask what is going on, in the same manner, that you might worry that you would be distracting a human driver that was doing something wild at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, a well-devised XAI won’t be taxing on the AI driving system, and thus you are free to engage in a lengthy dialogue with the XAI. In fact, the likeliest question that self-driving cars are going to get is how does the AI driving system function. The XAI ought to be readied to cope with that kind of question.\\xa0\\nThe one thing we probably should not expect XAI to handle will be those questions that are afield of the driving chore. For example, asking the XAI to explain the meaning of life is something that could be argued as out-of-bounds and above the pay grade of the AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt least until the day that AI does become sentient, then you can certainly ask away.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\nDeepfake is a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to a synthetic media usually in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness. Deepfakes use techniques from machine learning and AI to manipulate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.\\nDeepfakes applied to geography have the potential to falsify satellite image data, which could pose a national security threat. Scientists at the University of Washington (UW) are studying this, in the hopes of finding ways to detect fake satellite images and warn of its dangers.\\nBo Zhao, Assistant Professor of Geography, University of Washington\\n“This isn’t just Photoshopping things. It’s making data look uncannily realistic,” stated Bo Zhao, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the study, in a news release from the University of Washington. The study was published on April 21 in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science. “The techniques are already there. We’re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,” Zhao stated.\\nFake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement.\\nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm\\nNow with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks. The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019.\\n“We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter\\xadconnected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from SpaceNews.\\nTo study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this.\\nThe researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes.\\nSimulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such.\\nThe researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.\\nIn an interview with The Verge, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.\\n“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.\\nUS Army Researchers Also Working on Deepfake Detection\\nProfessor C.-C. Jay Kuo, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California\\nUS Army researchers are also working on a deepfake detection method. Researchers at the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory, in collaboration with Professor C.C. Jay Kuo’s research group at the University of Southern California, are examining the threat that deepfakes pose to our society and national security, according to a release from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL).\\nTheir work is featured in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector,” which will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2021 in July.\\nARL researchers Dr. Suya You and Dr. Shuowen (Sean) Hu noted that most state-of-the-art deepfake video detection and media forensics methods are based upon deep learning, which has inherent weaknesses in robustness, scalability, and portability.\\n“Due to the progression of generative neural networks, AI-driven deepfakes have advanced so rapidly that there is a scarcity of reliable techniques to detect and defend against them,” You stated. “We have an urgent need for an alternative paradigm that can understand the mechanism behind the startling performance of deepfakes, and to develop effective defense solutions with solid theoretical support.”\\nRelying on their experience with machine learning, signal analysis, and computer vision, the researchers developed a new theory and mathematical framework they call the Successive Subspace Learning, or SSL, as an innovative neural network architecture. SSL is the key innovation of DefakeHop, the researchers stated.\\n“SSL is an entirely new mathematical framework for neural network architecture developed from signal transform theory,” Kuo stated. “It is radically different from the traditional approach. It is very suitable for high-dimensional data that have short-, mid- and long-range covariance structures. SSL is a complete data-driven unsupervised framework, offering a brand-new tool for image processing and understanding tasks such as face biometrics.”\\nRead the source articles and information in a news release from the University of Washington, in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science,\\xa0 an account from SpaceNews,a release from the US Army Research Laboratory, and in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector.”',\n",

Now the challenge is to get the technologies to work together to reach for big business goals.\\nAdriana Karaboutis, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer, National Grid\\nThis was the message from Adriana Karaboutis, group chief information and digital officer at National Grid, speaking at the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium in a session on Accelerated Digital Transformation, held virtually recently.\\nThe effects of the crisis made organizations “double down on that focus and crystallization for what we need to do,” she stated in an account in CIO Dive\\nTo pursue IoT, standardization is a must, suggested Harmeen Mehta, chief digital and innovation officer at BT, the British multinational telecommunications firm. “If the world can consolidate a bit on standardization, it will help pick up speed,” stated Mehta. “What we’ve not done well as an industry is truly come together and make some hard choices” in converging around specific types of IoT technologies.\\nTechnologies and data streams playing off each other can lead to new outcomes, in the experience of David Neitz, CIO at engineering and construction company CDM Smith. Using NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano device, for example, CDM Smith is able to train an AI computer vision model to detect wrong-way drivers, he stated. The technology use case combines capabilities of sensors with the computing power of AI.\\n“You have someone sitting in a command center trying to monitor 300 screens,” stated Neitz, speaking on the panel. “Why rely on a human to be observant and alert?” Instead, the company relies on a mix of sensors and algorithms to monitor and track when drivers are using lanes in an erratic way, or how traffic is behaving around a construction zone.\\nAnother application finds CDM Smith combining IoT soil sensors, data analytics and weather information to predict when a potential landslide could impact a railroad track.\\nPandemic Has Accelerated the Move to Cloud Computing\\nThe pandemic seems to have accelerated the move to cloud computing. A recent survey of 750 cloud decision-makers found that 92% of represented enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy, and 90% have a hybrid cloud strategy. The results are contained in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report from Flexera, an IT asset management software company.\\nJim Ryan, President and CEO, Flexera\\n“COVID-19 has accelerated the migration to cloud computing,” stated Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Flexera, in a press release. “Still, cloud isn’t magic or the land of milk and honey. Companies are moving fast, facing challenges, and trying to connect cloud computing to business outcomes. The appetite for digital transformation is high, but real-world challenges—such as managing security and optimizing cloud spend—still must be addressed.”\\nCloud adoption among the respondents was as follows: AWS adoption grew to 77% (from 76% last year); Azure grew to 73% (from 63% last year); Google Cloud grew to 47% (from 35% last year); VMware Cloud on AWS grew to 24% (from 17% last year); Oracle Infrastructure Cloud grew to 29% (from 17% last year); IBM Public Cloud grew to 24% (from 13% last year); and Alibaba Cloud grew to 12% (from 7% last year).\\nThe key considerations CIOs are advised to take into account as they gravitate more of their IT operations to the cloud touch on infrastructure, processes and culture, advised a recent account in Forbes. They include:\\n\\nPutting Customers and Employees First. In the past year, organizations have transformed and served customers in new ways. Restaurants, for example, had to enable better ordering of food online to be picked up or delivered and paid for electronically. CIOs have transitioned from being “enablers” of digital transformation to being “drivers” of business change. The trend is seen as so produced that Gartner predicts that 25% of large-enterprise CIOs could become “COO by proxy” by 2024.\\nDeveloping ‘Enterprise Agility.’ Each company needs to determine its own path to competitive advantage, as in which approach to take for the digital and data journey, whether to emulate the infrastructure choices of digital native competitors or invent a new way as the company looks for a unique enterprise identity.\\n\\nIT Shifts Within Scaled, Agile Organizations\\nResearch from McKinsey & Co. on enterprise agility identifies five core IT shifts within scaled agile organizations. These include:\\n\\nSpeed. Information needs to be relevant, actionable & timely, whether for real-time scenarios such as fraud detection that triggers machine intervention, or monitoring that requires human judgment, “The notion of speed and pace is key,” stated the author of the Forbes account, Bruno Aziza, a technology entrepreneur who is the current Head of Data & Analytics for Google Cloud.\\nScale. The world is predicted to store 200 zettabytes [a zettabyte is 10 to the power of 21] of data by 2025, and 50% of all data will be in the cloud. “The question is: are your teams building for a world where capacity could be limitless? Or are they living in a world where only some data deserves to be stored?” Aziza queried. He suggests that team members look at more data; they don’t know which data will become more valuable over time.\\nSecurity. The number one concern of companies of all sizes in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report, is security. The higher the company’s cloud maturity, the higher the concern. In a world where more data comes from a range of sources and is used by more people across more use cases, security and data governance needs to be taken into account on day one, the author suggested.\\nHuman Intelligence. AI is important to digital transformation efforts; the AI Specialist is now one of the fastest growing jobs on LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report. Many organizations are looking to infuse AI to optimize their technical infrastructure and focus on the adoption of machine learning as part of intelligent application initiatives. “But many struggle to marry human intelligence with machine intelligence,” the author states. The best guidance he has found so far on when humans are better equipped than machines, is from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport, released in 2016.\\n\\nAziza recommends working to identify the use cases where machine intelligence is most appropriate and the ones where humans do a better job “augmenting” the machine’s capabilities.\\nRead the source articles and information from sessions of the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium, in CIO Dive, in a press release from Flexera, in Forbes and from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport.',\n",

Using drones to perform inspections also avoids the need to place workers at risk.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Simply put, drones enable us to provide needed views that are inaccessible, or otherwise too risky and expensive to capture by any other means,” stated Ryan Holmes, program manager of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for\\xa0Multivista\\xa0of Newton, Mass.,\\xa0which provides\\xa0UAV/drone services with remote pilots on staff. “We are using drones to help anywhere, from assessing land clearing and earthwork, insurance coverage, inspections, through to project completion and maintenance thereafter,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe data gathered through the drone can usually be accessed on any platform, be it desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, giving project data flexibility.

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene.\\xa0Let’s explore why.\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area.\\xa0There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0is\\xa0unlawfully parked\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0making your turn,\\xa0and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYour mind races as you\\xa0consider\\xa0your options.\\xa0\\nYou could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following your\\xa0turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0But\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.\\xa0\\nSadly, neither\\xa0option\\xa0is\\xa0satisfactory.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDriving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.\\xa0It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?\\xa0\\nYou might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0not\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoila:\\xa0the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene.\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.\\xa0\\nRather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.\\xa0There are some potential downsides.\\xa0\\nA human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at once. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0thing\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0take in extra information. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0Here is an intriguing question:\\xa0Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?\\xa0\\nLet’s unpack the matter and see.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nThe AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVia a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.\\xa0\\nThat’s bound to create difficulties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s something else to ponder.\\xa0Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.\\xa0This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0imagined. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’ll throw you another curveball.\\xa0Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?\\xa0\\nOn the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0viably\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.\\xa0\\nWithout seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (i.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can add more icing to that cake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.\\xa0\\nAll told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.\\xa0\\nVarious experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.\\xa0\\nFor example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0sensory\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI mention that this should be considered an\\xa0add-on\\xa0since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.\\xa0\\nThere are other twists and turns to be considered.\\xa0\\nFor example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24×7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).\\xa0\\nThe key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0as including perhaps\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne last quick point for the moment on this topic:\\xa0There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird’s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.\\xa0\\nAll of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?\\xa0\\nSuppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSimilarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

              "[{'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\nThe AI stack defined by Carnegie Mellon University is fundamental to the approach being taken by the US Army for its AI development platform efforts, according to Isaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist at the US Army AI Integration Center, speaking at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0event held in-person and virtually from Alexandria, Va., last week.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIsaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist, US Army AI Integration Center\\n“If we want to move the Army from legacy systems through digital modernization, one of the biggest issues I have found is the difficulty in abstracting away the differences in applications,” he said. “The most important part of digital transformation is the middle layer, the platform that makes it easier to be on the cloud or on a local computer.” The desire is to be able to move your software platform to another platform, with the same ease\\xa0with\\xa0which a new smartphone carries over the user’s contacts and histories.\\xa0\\xa0\\nEthics cuts across all layers of the AI application stack, which positions the planning stage at the top, followed by decision support, modeling, machine learning, massive data management and the device layer or platform at the bottom.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I am advocating that we think of the stack as a core infrastructure and a way for applications to be deployed and not to be siloed in our approach,” he said. “We need to create a development environment for a globally-distributed workforce.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Army has been working on a Common Operating Environment Software (Coes) platform, first announced in 2017, a design for DOD work that is scalable, agile, modular, portable and open. “It is suitable for a broad range of AI projects,” Faber said. For executing the effort, “The devil is in the details,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Army is working with CMU and private companies on a prototype platform, including with\\xa0Visimo\\xa0of Coraopolis, Pa., which offers AI development services. Faber said he prefers to collaborate and coordinate with private industry rather than buying products off the shelf. “The problem with that is, you are stuck with the value you are being provided by that one vendor, which is usually not designed for the challenges of DOD networks,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nArmy Trains a Range of Tech Teams in AI\\xa0\\nThe Army engages in AI workforce development efforts for several teams, including:\\xa0 leadership, professionals with graduate degrees; technical staff, which is put through training to get certified; and AI users.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTech teams in the Army have different areas of focus include: general purpose software development, operational data science, deployment which includes analytics, and a machine learning operations team, such as a large team required to build a computer vision system. “As folks come through the workforce, they need a place to collaborate, build and share,” Faber said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTypes of projects include diagnostic, which might be combining streams of historical data, predictive and prescriptive, which recommends a course of action based on a prediction. “At the far end is AI; you don’t start with that,” said Faber. The developer has to solve three problems: data engineering, the AI development platform, which he called “the green bubble,” and the deployment platform, which he called “the red bubble.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“These are mutually exclusive and all interconnected. Those teams of different people need to programmatically coordinate. Usually a good project team will have people from each of those bubble areas,” he said. “If you have not done this yet, do not try to solve the green bubble problem. It makes no sense to pursue AI until you have an operational need.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked by a participant which group is the most difficult to reach and train, Faber said without hesitation, “The hardest to reach are the executives. They need to learn what the value is to be provided by the AI ecosystem. The biggest challenge is how to communicate that value,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel Discusses AI Use Cases with the Most Potential\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn a panel on Foundations of Emerging AI, moderator Curt Savoie, program director, Global Smart Cities Strategies for IDC, the market research firm, asked what emerging AI use case has the most potential.\\xa0\\xa0\\nJean-Charles Lede, autonomy tech advisor for the US Air Force, Office of Scientific Research, said,” I would point to decision advantages at the edge, supporting pilots and operators, and decisions at the back, for mission and resource planning.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nKrista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor\\nKrista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor, said, “Natural language processing is an opportunity to open the doors to AI in the Department of Labor,” she said. “Ultimately, we are dealing with data on people, programs,\\xa0and organizations.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSavoie asked what are the big risks and dangers the panelists see when implementing AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the General Services Administration (GSA), said in a typical IT organization using traditional software development, the impact of a decision by a developer only goes so far. With AI, “You have to consider the impact on a whole class of people, constituents,\\xa0and stakeholders. With a simple change in algorithms, you could be delaying benefits to millions of people or making incorrect inferences at scale. That’s the most important risk,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe said he asks his contract partners to have “humans in the loop and humans on the loop.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nKinnard seconded this, saying, “We have no intention of removing humans from the loop. It’s really about empowering people to make better decisions.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe emphasized the importance of monitoring the AI models after they are deployed. “Models can drift as the data underlying the changes,” she said. “So you need a level of critical thinking to not only do the task, but to assess whether what the AI model is doing is acceptable.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe added, “We have built out use cases and partnerships across the government to make sure we’re implementing responsible AI. We will never replace people with algorithms.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLede of the Air Force said, “We often have use cases where the data does not exist. We cannot explore 50 years of war data, so we use simulation. The risk is in teaching an algorithm that you have a ‘simulation to real gap’ that is a real risk. You are not sure how the algorithms will map to the real world.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nChaudhry emphasized the importance of a testing strategy for AI systems. He warned of developers “who get enamored with a tool and forget the purpose of the exercise.” He recommended the development manager design in independent verification and validation strategy. “Your testing, that is where you have to focus your energy as a leader. The leader needs an idea in mind, before committing resources, on how they will justify whether the investment was a success.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLede of the Air Force talked about the importance of\\xa0explainability. “I am a technologist. I don’t\\xa0do laws. The ability for the AI function to explain in a way a human can interact with, is important. The AI is a partner that we have a dialogue with, instead of the AI coming up with a conclusion that we have no way of verifying,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdvancing trustworthy AI and machine learning to mitigate agency risk is a priority for the US Department of Energy (DOE), and identifying best practices for implementing AI at scale is a priority for the US General Services Administration (GSA).\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s what attendees learned in two sessions at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0live and virtual event held in Alexandria, Va. last week.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPamela Isom, Director of the AI and Technology Office, DOE\\nPamela Isom, Director of the AI and Technology Office at the DOE, who spoke on Advancing Trustworthy AI and ML Techniques for Mitigating Agency Risks, has been involved in proliferating the use of AI across the agency for several years. With an emphasis on applied AI and data science, she oversees risk mitigation policies and standards and has been involved with applying AI to save lives, fight fraud, and strengthen the cybersecurity infrastructure.\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe emphasized the need for the AI project effort to be part of a strategic portfolio. “My office is there to drive a holistic view on AI and to mitigate risk by bringing us together to address challenges,” she said. The effort is assisted by the DOE’s AI and Technology Office, which is focused on transforming the DOE into a world-leading AI enterprise by accelerating research, development, delivery and the adoption of AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I am telling my organization to be mindful of the fact that you can have tons and tons of data, but it might not be representative,” she said. Her team looks at examples from international partners, industry, academia and other agencies for outcomes “we can trust” from systems incorporating AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We know that AI is disruptive, in trying to do what humans do and do it better,” she said. “It is beyond human capability; it goes beyond data in spreadsheets; it can tell me what I’m going to do next before I contemplate it myself. It’s that powerful,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a result, close attention must be paid to data sources. “AI is vital to the economy and our national security. We need precision; we need algorithms we can trust; we need accuracy. We don’t need biases,” Isom said, adding, “And don’t forget that you need to monitor the output of the models long after they have been deployed.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nExecutive Orders Guide GSA AI Work\\xa0\\nExecutive Order 14028, a detailed set of actions to address the cybersecurity of government agencies, issued in May of this year, and Executive Order 13960, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the Federal government, issued in December 2020, provide valuable guides to her work.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo help manage the risk of AI development and deployment, Isom has produced the AI Risk Management Playbook, which provides guidance around system features and mitigation techniques. It also has a filter for ethical and trustworthy principles which are considered throughout AI lifecycle stages and risk types. Plus, the playbook ties to relevant Executive Orders.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd it provides examples, such as your results came in at 80%\\xa0accuracy, but you wanted 90%. “Something is wrong there,” Isom said, adding, “The playbook helps you look at these types of problems and what you can do to mitigate risk, and what factors you should weigh as you design and build your project.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile internal to DOE at present, the agency is looking into next steps for an external version. “We will share it with other federal agencies soon,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGSA Best Practices for Scaling AI Projects Outlined\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations, AI Center of Excellence (CoE), GSA\\nAnil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the AI Center of Excellence (CoE) of the GSA, who spoke on Best Practices for Implementing AI at Scale, has over 20 years of experience in technology delivery, operations and program management in the defense, intelligence and national security sectors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe mission of the\\xa0CoE\\xa0is to accelerate technology modernization across the government, improve the public experience and increase operational efficiency. “Our business model is to partner with industry subject matter experts to solve problems,” Chaudhry said, adding, “We are not in the business of recreating industry solutions and duplicating them.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0CoE\\xa0is providing recommendations to partner agencies and working with them to implement AI systems as the federal government engages heavily in AI development. “For AI, the government landscape is vast. Every federal agency has some sort of AI project going on right now,” he said, and the maturity of AI experience varies widely across agencies.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTypical use cases he is seeing include having AI focus on increasing speed and efficiency, on cost savings and cost avoidance, on improved response time and increased quality and compliance. As one best practice, he recommended the agencies\\xa0vet their commercial experience\\xa0with the large datasets they will encounter in government.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’re talking petabytes and exabytes here, of structured and unstructured data,” Chaudhry said.\\xa0[Ed. Note: A petabyte is 1,000 terabytes.]\\xa0“Also ask industry partners about their strategies and processes on how they do macro and micro trend analysis, and what their experience has been in the deployment of bots such as in Robotic Process Automation, and how they demonstrate sustainability as a result of drift of data.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe also asks potential industry partners to\\xa0describe the AI talent on their team\\xa0or what talent they can access. If the company is weak on AI talent, Chaudhry would ask, “If you buy something, how will you know you got what you wanted when you have no way of evaluating it?”\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe added, “A best practice in implementing AI is defining how you train your workforce to leverage AI tools, techniques and practices, and to define how you grow and mature your workforce. Access to talent leads to either success or failure in AI projects, especially when it comes to scaling a pilot up to a fully deployed system.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn another best practice, Chaudhry recommended examining the industry partner’s\\xa0access to financial capital.\\xa0“AI is a field where the flow of capital is highly volatile. “You cannot predict or project that you will spend X amount of dollars this year to get where you want to be,” he said, because an AI development team may need to explore another hypothesis, or clean up some data that may not be transparent or is potentially biased. “If you don’t have access to funding, it is a risk your project will fail,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother best practice is\\xa0access to logistical capital, such as the data\\xa0 that sensors collect for an AI IoT system. “AI requires an enormous amount of data that is authoritative and timely. Direct access to that data is critical,” Chaudhry said. He recommended that data sharing agreements\\xa0 be in place with organizations relevant to the AI system. “You might not need it right away, but having access to the data, so you could immediately use it and to have thought through the privacy issues before you need the data, is a good practice for scaling AI programs,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA final best practice is planning of\\xa0physical infrastructure,\\xa0such as data center space. “When you are in a pilot, you need to know how much capacity you need to reserve at your data center, and how many end points you need to manage” when the application scales up, Chaudhry said, adding, “This all ties back to access to capital and all the other best practices.“\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile\\xa0AI in hiring is now widely used for writing job descriptions, screening candidates, and automating interviews, it poses a risk of wide discrimination if not implemented carefully.\\xa0\\nKeith Sonderling, Commissioner, US Equal Opportunity Commission\\nThat was the message from Keith Sonderling, Commissioner with the US Equal Opportunity Commision, speaking at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0event held live and virtually in Alexandria, Va., last week. Sonderling is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit discrimination against job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or\\xa0disability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The thought that AI would become mainstream in HR departments was closer to science fiction two year ago, but the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which AI is being used by employers,” he said. “Virtual recruiting is now here to stay.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt’s a busy time for HR professionals. “The great resignation is leading to the great rehiring, and AI will play a role in that like we have not seen before,” Sonderling said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI has been employed for years in hiring—“It did not happen overnight.”—for tasks including chatting with applications, predicting whether a candidate would take the job, projecting what type of employee they would be and mapping out upskilling and reskilling opportunities. “In short, AI is now making all the decisions once made by HR personnel,” which he did not characterize as good or bad.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Carefully designed and properly used, AI has the potential to make the workplace more fair,” Sonderling said. “But carelessly implemented, AI could discriminate on a scale we have never seen before by an HR professional.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTraining Datasets for AI Models Used for Hiring Need to Reflect Diversity\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is because AI models rely on training data. If the company’s current workforce is used as the basis for training, “It will replicate the status quo. If it’s one gender or one race primarily, it will replicate that,” he said. Conversely, AI can help mitigate risks of hiring bias by race, ethnic background, or disability status. “I want to see AI improve on workplace discrimination,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmazon began building a hiring application in 2014, and found over time that it discriminated against women in its recommendations, because the AI model was trained on a dataset of the company’s own hiring record for the previous 10 years, which was primarily of males. Amazon developers tried to correct it but ultimately scrapped the system in 2017.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFacebook has recently agreed to pay $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the US government that the social media company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules, according to an account from\\xa0Reuters. The case centered on Facebook’s use of what it called its PERM program for labor certification. The government found that Facebook refused to hire American workers for jobs that had been reserved for temporary visa holders under the PERM program.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Excluding people from the hiring pool is a violation,” Sonderling said.\\xa0 If the AI program “withholds the existence of the job opportunity to that\\xa0class, so\\xa0they cannot exercise their rights, or if it downgrades a protected class, it is within our domain,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEmployment assessments, which became more common after World War II, have provided\\xa0 high value to HR managers and with help from AI they have the potential to minimize bias in hiring. “At the same time, they are vulnerable to claims of discrimination, so\\xa0employers\\xa0need to be careful and cannot take a hands-off approach,” Sonderling said. “Inaccurate data will amplify bias in decision-making. Employers must be vigilant against discriminatory outcomes.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe recommended researching solutions from vendors who vet data for risks of bias on the basis of race, sex, and other factors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne example is from\\xa0HireVue\\xa0of South Jordan, Utah, which has\\xa0built a\\xa0hiring platform predicated on the US Equal Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, designed specifically to mitigate unfair hiring practices, according to an account from\\xa0allWork.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA post on AI ethical principles on its website states in part, “Because\\xa0HireVue\\xa0uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or\\xa0propagation\\xa0of bias against any group or individual. We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible. We also continue to advance our abilities to monitor, detect, and mitigate bias. We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlso, “Our data scientists and IO psychologists build\\xa0HireVue\\xa0Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment’s predictive accuracy. The result is a highly valid, bias-mitigated assessment that helps to enhance human decision making while actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nDr. Ed\\xa0Ikeguchi, CEO,\\xa0AiCure\\nThe issue of bias in datasets used to train AI models is not confined to hiring. Dr. Ed\\xa0Ikeguchi, CEO of\\xa0AiCure, an AI analytics company working in the life sciences industry, stated in a recent account in\\xa0HealthcareITNews, “AI is only as strong as the data it’s fed, and lately that data backbone’s credibility is being increasingly called into question. Today’s AI developers lack access to large, diverse data sets on which to train and validate new tools.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe added, “They often need to leverage open-source datasets, but many of these were trained using computer programmer volunteers, which is a predominantly white population. Because algorithms are often trained on single-origin data samples with limited diversity, when applied in real-world scenarios to a broader population of different races, genders, ages, and more, tech that appeared highly accurate in research may prove unreliable.”\\xa0\\nAlso, “There needs to be an element of governance and peer review for all algorithms, as even the most solid and tested algorithm is bound to have unexpected results arise. An algorithm is never done learning—it must be constantly developed and fed more data to improve.”\\xa0\\nAnd, “As an industry, we need to become more skeptical of AI’s conclusions and encourage transparency in the industry. Companies should readily answer basic questions, such as ‘How was the algorithm trained? On what basis did it draw this conclusion?”\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information at\\xa0AI World Government, from\\xa0Reuters\\xa0and from\\xa0HealthcareITNews.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore companies are successfully exploiting predictive maintenance systems that combine AI and IoT sensors to collect data that anticipates breakdowns and recommends preventive action before break or machines fail, in a demonstration of an AI use case with proven value.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis growth is reflected in optimistic market forecasts. The predictive maintenance market is sized at $6.9 billion today and is projected to grow to $28.2 billion by 2026, according to a report from\\xa0IoT Analytics\\xa0of Hamburg, Germany. The firm\\xa0counts over 280 vendors offering solutions in the market today, projected to grow to over 500 by 2026.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFernando Bruegge, Analyst, IoT Analytics, Hamburg, Germany\\n“This research is a wake-up call to those that claim IoT is failing,” stated analyst Fernando Bruegge, author of the report, adding, “For companies that own industrial assets or sell equipment, now is the time to invest in predictive maintenance-type solutions.” And, “Enterprise technology firms need to prepare to integrate predictive maintenance solutions into their offerings,” Bruegge suggested.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere is a review of some specific experience with predictive maintenance systems that combine AI and IoT sensors.\\xa0\\nAircraft engine manufacturer\\xa0Rolls-Royce\\xa0is\\xa0deploying predictive analytics\\xa0to help reduce the amount of carbon its engines produce, while also optimizing maintenance to help customers keep planes in the air longer, according to a recent account in\\xa0CIO.\\xa0\\nRolls-Royce built an Intelligent Engine platform to monitor engine flight, gathering data on weather conditions and how pilots are flying. Machine learning is applied to the data to customize maintenance regimes for individual engines.\\xa0\\nStuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer, Rolls-Royce\\n“We’re tailoring our maintenance regimes to make sure that we’re optimizing for the life an engine has, not the life the manual says it should have,” stated Stuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer at Rolls-Royce. “It’s truly variable service, looking at each engine as an individual engine.”\\xa0\\nCustomers are seeing less service interruption. “Rolls-Royce has been monitoring engines and charging per hour for at least 20 years,” Hughes stated. “That part of the business isn’t new. But as we’ve evolved, we’ve begun to treat the engine as a singular engine. It’s much more about the personalization of that engine.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nPredictive analytics is being applied in healthcare as well as in the manufacturing industry. Kaiser Permanente, the integrated managed care consortium based in Oakland, Calif. Is using predictive analytics to identify non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients at risk of rapid deterioration.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile non-ICU patients that require unexpected transfers to the ICU constitute less than\\xa04%\\xa0of the total hospital population, they account for 20%\\xa0of all hospital deaths, according to Dr. Gabriel Escobar, research scientist, Division of Research, and regional director, Hospital Operations Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California.\\xa0\\nKaiser Permanente Practicing Predictive Maintenance in Healthcare\\xa0\\nKaiser Permanente developed the Advanced Alert Monitor (AAM) system, leveraging three predictive analytic models to analyze more than 70 factors in a given patient’s electronic health record to generate a composite risk score.\\xa0\\n“The AAM system synthesizes and analyzes vital statistics, lab results, and other variables to generate hourly deterioration risk scores for adult hospital patients in the medical-surgical and transitional care units,” stated Dick Daniels, executive vice president and CIO of Kaiser Permanente in the CIO account. “Remote hospital teams evaluate the risk scores every hour and notify rapid response teams in the hospital when potential deterioration is detected. The rapid response team conducts bedside evaluation of the patient and calibrates the course treatment with the hospitalist.”\\xa0\\nIn advice to other practitioners, Daniels recommended a focus on how the tool will be fit into the workflow of health care teams. “It took us about five years to perform the initial mapping of the electronic medical record backend and develop the predictive models,” Daniels stated. “It then took us another two to three years to transition these models into a live web services application that could be used operationally.”\\xa0\\nIn an example from the food industry, a PepsiCo Frito-Lay plant in Fayetteville, Tenn. is using predictive maintenance successfully, with year-to-date equipment downtime at 0.75%\\xa0and unplanned downtime at 2.88%, according to Carlos Calloway, the site’s reliability engineering manager, in an account in\\xa0PlantServices.\\xa0\\nExamples of monitoring include: vibration readings confirmed by ultrasound helped to prevent a PC combustion blower motor from failing and shutting down the whole potato chip department; infrared analysis of the main pole for the plant’s GES automated warehouse detected a hot fuse holder, which helped to avoid a shutdown of the entire warehouse; and increased acid levels were detected in oil samples from a baked extruder gearbox, indicating oil degradation, which enabled prevention of a shutdown of Cheetos Puffs production.\\xa0\\nThe Frito-Lay plant produces more than 150 million pounds of product per year, including Lays, Ruffles, Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos, and Tostitos.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe types of monitoring include vibration analysis, used on mechanical applications, which is processed with the help of a third-party company which sends alerts to the plant for investigation and resolution.\\xa0Another service partner performs quarterly vibration monitoring on selected equipment. All motor control center rooms and electrical panels are monitored with quarterly infrared analysis, which is also used on electrical equipment, some rotating equipment, and heat exchangers. In addition, the plant has done ultrasonic monitoring for more than 15 years, and it is “kind of like the pride and joy of our site from a predictive standpoint,” stated Calloway.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe plan has a number of products in place from UE Systems of Elmsford, NY, supplier of ultrasonic instruments, hardware and software, and training for predictive maintenance.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLouisiana Alumina Plant Automating Bearing Maintenance\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBearings, which wear over time under varying conditions of weather and temperature in the case of automobiles, are a leading candidate for IoT monitoring and predictive maintenance with AI. The\\xa0Noranda Alumina\\xa0plant in Gramercy, La. is finding a big payoff from its investment in a system to improve the lubrication of bearings in its production equipment.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe system has resulted in a 60%\\xa0decline in bearing changes in the second year of using the new lubrication system, translating to some $900,000 in savings on bearings that did not need to be replaced and avoided downtime.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Four hours of downtime is about $1 million dollars’ worth of lost production,” stated Russell Goodwin, a reliability engineer and millwright instructor at Noranda Alumina, in the\\xa0PlantServices\\xa0account, which was based on presentations at the Leading Reliability 2021 event.\\xa0\\nThe Noranda Alumina plant is the only alumina plant operating in the US.\\xa0“If we shut down, you’ll need to import it,” stated Goodwin. The plant experiences pervasive dust, dirt, and caustic substances, which complicate efforts at improved reliability and maintenance practices.\\xa0\\xa0\\nNoranda Alumina tracks all motors and gearboxes at 1,500 rpm and higher with vibration readings, and most below 1,500 with ultrasound. Ultrasonic monitoring, of sound in ranges beyond human hearing, was introduced to the plant after Goodwin joined the company in 2019. At the time, grease monitoring had room for improvement. “If grease was not visibly coming out of the seal, the mechanical supervisor did not count the round as complete,” stated Goodwin.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAfter introducing automation, the greasing system has improved dramatically, he stated. The system was also able to detect bearings in a belt whose bearings were wearing out too quickly due to contamination. “Tool-enabled tracking helped to prove that it wasn’t improper greasing, but rather the bearing was made improperly,” stated Goodwin.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information in\\xa0\\xa0IoT Analytics,\\xa0in\\xa0CIO\\xa0and in\\xa0PlantServices.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe already\\xa0expect that humans to exhibit flashes of brilliance.\\xa0It might not happen all the time, but the act itself is welcomed and not altogether disturbing when\\xa0it occurs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat about when Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to display an act of novelty?\\xa0Any such instance is bound to get our attention; questions arise right away.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHow did the AI come up with the apparent out-of-the-blue insight or novel indication? Was it a mistake, or did it fit within the parameters of what the AI was expected to produce? There is also the immediate consideration of whether the AI somehow is slipping toward the precipice of becoming sentient.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPlease be aware that no AI system in existence is anywhere close to reaching sentience, despite the\\xa0claims and falsehoods tossed around in the media. As such, if today’s AI seems to do something that appears to be a novel act, you should not leap to the conclusion that this is a sign of human insight within technology or the emergence of human ingenuity among AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s an anthropomorphic bridge too far.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe reality is that any such AI “insightful” novelties are based on various concrete computational algorithms and tangible data-based pattern matching.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn today’s column, we’ll be taking a close look at an example of an AI-powered novel act, illustrated via the game of Go, and relate these facets to the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars as a means of understanding the AI-versus-human related ramifications.\\xa0\\nRealize that the capacity to spot or suggest a novelty is being done methodically by an AI system, while, in contrast, no one can say for sure how humans can devise novel thoughts or intuitions.\\xa0\\nPerhaps we too are bound by some internal mechanistic-like facets, or maybe there is something else going on. Someday, hopefully, we will crack open the secret inner workings of the mind and finally know how we think. I suppose it might undercut the mystery and magical aura that oftentimes goes along with those of us that have moments of outside-the-box visions, though I’d trade that enigma to know how the cups-and-balls trickery truly functions (going behind the curtain, as it were).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of novelty, a famous game match involving the playing of Go can provide useful illumination on this overall topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGo is a popular board game\\xa0in the same complexity category as chess. Arguments are made about which is tougher, chess or Go, but I’m not going to get mired into that morass. For the sake of civil discussion, the key point is that Go is highly complex and requires intense mental concentration especially\\xa0at the\\xa0tournament level.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGenerally, Go consists of trying to capture territory on a standard Go board, consisting of a 19 by 19 grid of intersecting lines. For those of you that have never tried playing Go, the closest similar kind of game might be the connect-the-dots that you played in childhood, which involves grabbing up territory, though Go is magnitudes more involved.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is no need for you to know anything in particular about Go to get the gist of what will be discussed next regarding the act of human novelty and the act of AI novelty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA famous Go competition took place about four years ago that pitted one of the world’s top professional Go players, Lee Sedol, against an AI program that had been crafted to play Go, coined as AlphaGo. There is a riveting documentary about the contest and plenty of write-ups and online videos that have in detail covered the match, including post-game analysis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPut yourself back in time to 2016 and relive what happened.\\xa0\\nMost AI developers did not anticipate that the AI of that time would be proficient enough to beat a top Go player. Sure, AI had already been able to best some top chess players, and thus offered a glimmer of expectation that Go would eventually be equally undertaken, but there weren’t any Go programs that had been able to compete at the pinnacle levels of human Go players. Most expected that it would probably be around the year 2020 or so before the capabilities of AI would be sufficient to compete in world-class Go tournaments.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDeepMind Created AlphaGo Using Deep Learning, Machine Learning\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA small-sized tech company named DeepMind Technologies devised the AlphaGo AI playing system (the firm was later acquired by Google). Using techniques from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the AlphaGo program was being revamped and adjusted right up to the actual tournament, a typical kind of last-ditch developer contortions that many of us have done when trying to get the last bit of added edge into something that is about to be demonstrated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis was a monumental competition that had garnered global interest.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHuman players of Go were doubtful that the AlphaGo program would win. Many AI techies were doubtful that AlphaGo would win. Even the AlphaGo developers were unsure of how well the program would do, including the stay-awake-at-night fears that the AlphaGo program would hit a bug or go into a kind of delusional mode and make outright mistakes and play foolishly.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA million dollars in prize money was put into the pot for the competition. There would be five Go games played, one per day, along with associated rules about taking breaks, etc. Some predicted that Sedol would handily win all five games, doing so without cracking a sweat. AI pundits were clinging to the hope that AlphaGo would win at least one of the five games, and otherwise, present itself as a respectable level of Go player throughout the contest.\\xa0\\nIn the first match, AlphaGo won.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis was pretty much a worldwide shocker. Sedol was taken aback. Lots of Go players were surprised that a computer program could compete and beat someone at Sedol’s level of play. Everyone began to give some street cred to the AlphaGo program and the efforts by the AI developers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTension grew for the next match.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the second game, it was anticipated that Sedol might significantly change his approach to the contest. Perhaps he had been overconfident coming into the competition, some harshly asserted, and the loss of the first game would awaken him to the importance of putting all his concentration into the tournament. Or, possibly he had played as though he was competing with a lesser capable player and thus was not pulling out all the stops to try and win the match.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat happened in the second game?\\xa0\\nTurns out that AlphaGo prevailed, again, and also did something that was seemingly remarkable for those that avidly play Go. On the 37th\\xa0move of the match, the AlphaGo program opted to make placement onto the Go board in a spot that nobody especially anticipated. It was a surprise move, coming partway through a match that otherwise was relatively conventional in the nature of the moves being made by both Sedol and AlphaGo.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the time, in real-time, rampant speculation was that the move was an utter gaffe on the part of the AlphaGo program.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nInstead, it became famous as a novel move, known now as “Move 37” and heralded in Go and used colloquially overall to suggest any instance when AI does something of a novel or unexpected manner.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn the third match, AlphaGo won again, now having successfully beaten Sedol in a 3-out-of-5 winner competition. They\\xa0continued though to\\xa0play a fourth and a fifth game.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDuring the fourth game, things were tight as usual and the match play was going head-to-head (well, head versus AI). Put yourself into the shoes of Sedol. In one sense, he wasn’t just a Go player, he was somehow representing all of humanity (an unfair and misguided viewpoint, but pervasive anyway), and the pressure was on him to win at least one game. Just even one game would be something to hang your hat on, and bolster faith in mankind (again, a nonsensical way to look at it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the seventy-eighth move of the fourth game, Sedol made a so-called “wedge” play that was not conventional and surprised onlookers. The next move by AlphaGo was rotten and diminished the likelihood of a win by the AI system. After additional play, ultimately AlphaGo tossed in the towel and resigned from the match, thus Sedol finally had a win against the AI in his belt. He ended-up losing the fifth game, so AlphaGo won four games, Sedol won one). His move also became famous, generally known as “Move 78” in the lore of Go playing.\\xa0\\nSomething else that is worthwhile to know about involves the overarching strategy that AlphaGo was crafted to utilize.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen you play a game, let’s say connect-the-dots, you can aim to grab as many squares at each moment of play, doing so under the belief that inevitably you will then win by the accumulation of those tactically-oriented successes. Human players of Go are often apt to play that way, as it can be said too of chess players, and nearly any kind of game playing altogether.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother approach involves playing to win, even if only by the thinnest of margins, as long as you win. In that case, you might not be motivated for each tactical move to gain near-term territory or score immediate points, and be willing instead to play a larger scope game per se. The proverbial mantra is that if you are shortsighted, you might win some of the battles, but could eventually lose the war. Therefore, it might be a better strategy to keep your eye on the prize, winning the war, albeit if it means that there are battles and skirmishes to be lost along the way.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe AI developers devised AlphaGo with that kind of macro-perspective underlying how the AI system functioned.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHumans can have an especially hard time choosing at the moment to make a move that might look bad or ill-advised, such as giving up territory, finding themselves to be unable to grit their teeth, and taking a lump or two during play. The embarrassment at the instant is difficult to offset by betting that it is going to ultimately be okay, and you will prevail in the end.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor an AI system, there is no semblance of that kind of sentiment involved, and it is all about calculated odds and probabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow that we’ve covered the legendary Go match, let’s consider some lessons learned about novelty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe “Move 38” made by the AI system was not magical. It was an interesting move, for sure, and the AI developers later indicated that the move was one that the AI had calculated would rarely be undertaken by a human player.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis can be interpreted in two ways (at least).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne interpretation is that a human player would not make that move because humans are right and know that it would be a lousy move.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother interpretation is that humans would not make that move due to a belief that the move is unwise, but this could be a result of the humans insufficiently assessing the ultimate value of the move, in the long-run, and getting caught up in a shorter time frame semblance of play.\\xa0\\nIn this instance, it turned out to be a good move—maybe a brilliant move—and turned the course of the game to the advantage of the AI. Thus, what looked like brilliance was in fact a calculated move that few humans would have imagined as valuable and for which jostled humans to rethink how they think about such matters.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome useful recap lessons:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShowcasing Human Self-Limited Insight.\\xa0When the AI does something seemingly novel, it might be viewed as novel simply because humans have already predetermined what is customary and anything beyond that is blunted by the assumption that it is unworthy or mistaken. You could say that we are mentally trapped by our own drawing of the lines of what is considered as inside versus outside the box.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHumans Exploiting AI For Added Insight. Humans can gainfully assess an AI-powered novelty to potentially re-calibrate human thinking on a given topic, enlarging our understanding via leveraging something that the AI, via its vast calculative capacity, might detect or spot that we have not yet so ascertained. Thus, besides admiring the novelty, we ought to seek to improve our mental prowess by whatever source shines brightly including an AI system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI Novelty Is A Dual-Edged Sword.\\xa0We need to be mindful of all AI systems and their possibility of acting in a novel way, which could be good or could be bad. In the Go game, it worked out well. In other circumstances, the AI exploiting the novelty route might go off the tracks, as it were.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s see how this can be made tangible via exploring the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered a Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at a Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Acts Of Novelty\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could say that the AI is playing a game, a driving game, requiring tactical decision-making and strategic planning, akin to when playing Go or chess, though in this case involving life-or-death matters driving a multi-ton car on our public roadways.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur base assumption is that the AI driving system is going to always take a tried-and-true approach to any driving decisions. This assumption is somewhat shaped around a notion that AI is a type of robot or automata that is bereft of any human biases or human foibles.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn reality, there is no reason to make this kind of assumption. Yes, we can generally rule out the aspect that the AI is not going to display the emotion of a human ilk, and we also know that the AI will not be drunk or DUI in its driving efforts. Nonetheless, if the AI has been trained using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), it can pick up subtleties of human behavioral patterns in the data about human driving, out of which it will likewise utilize or mimic in choosing its driving actions (for example, see my column postings involving an analysis of potential racial biases in AI and the possibility of gender biases).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTurning back to the topic of novelty, let’s ponder a specific use case.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA few years ago, I was driving on an open highway, going at the prevailing speed of around 65 miles per hour, and something nearly unimaginable occurred. A car coming toward me in the opposing lane, and likely traveling at around 60 to 70 miles per hour, suddenly and unexpectedly veered into my lane. It was one of those moments that you cannot anticipate.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere did not appear to be any reason for the other driver to be headed toward me, in my lane of traffic, and coming at me for an imminent and bone-chillingly terrifying head-on collision. If there had been debris on the other lane, it might have been a clue that perhaps this other driver was simply trying to swing around the obstruction. No debris. If there was a slower moving car, the driver might have wanted to do a fast end-around to get past it. Nope, there was absolutely no discernible basis for this radical and life-threatening maneuver.\\xa0\\nWhat would you do?\\xa0\\nCome on, hurry, the clock is ticking, and you have just a handful of split seconds to make a life-or-death driving decision.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could stay in your lane and hope that the other driver realizes the error of their ways, opting to veer back into their lane at the last moment. Or, you could proactively go into the opposing lane, giving the other driver a clear path in your lane, but this could be a chancy game of chicken whereby the other driver chooses to go back into their lane (plus, there was other traffic further behind that driver, so going into the opposing lane was quite dicey).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so do you stay in your lane or veer away into the opposing lane?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI dare say that most people would be torn between those two options. Neither one is palatable.\\xa0\\nSuppose the AI of a self-driving car was faced with the same circumstance.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat would the AI do?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that even if the AI had been fed with thousands upon thousands of miles of driving via a database about human driving while undergoing the ML/DL training, there might not be any instances of a head-to-head nature and thus no prior pattern to utilize for making this onerous decision.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnyway, here’s a twist.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that the AI calculated the probabilities involving which way to go, and in some computational manner came to the conclusion that the self-driving car should go into the ditch that was at the right of the roadway. This was intended to avoid entirely a collision with the other car (the AI estimated that a head-on collision would be near-certain death for the occupants). The AI estimated that going into the ditch at such high speed would indisputably wreck the car and cause great bodily injury to the occupants, but the odds of assured death were (let’s say) calculated as lower than the head-on option possibilities (this is a variant of the infamous Trolley Problem, as covered in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’m betting that you would concede that most humans would be relatively unwilling to aim purposely into that ditch, which they know for sure is going to be a wreck and potential death, while instead willing (reluctantly) to take a hoped-for chance of either veering into the other lane or staying on course and wishing for the best.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn some sense, the AI might seem to have made a novel choice. It is one that (we’ll assume) few humans would have given any explicit thought toward.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nReturning to the earlier recap of the points about AI novelty, you could suggest that in this example, the AI has exceeded a human self-imposed limitation by the AI having considered otherwise “unthinkable” options. From this, perhaps we can learn to broaden our view for options that otherwise don’t seem apparent.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other recap element was that the AI novelty can be a dual-edged sword.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf the AI did react by driving into the ditch, and you were inside the self-driving car, and you got badly injured, would you later believe that the AI acted in a novel manner or that it acted mistakenly or adversely?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome might say that if you lived to ask that question, apparently the AI made the right choice. The counter-argument is that if the AI had gone with one of the other choices, perhaps you would have sailed right past the other car and not gotten a single scratch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor those of you wondering what actually did happen, my lucky stars were looking over me that day, and I survived with nothing more than a close call. I decided to remain in my lane, though it was tempting to veer into the opposing lane, and by some miracle, the other driver suddenly went back into the opposing lane.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen I tell the story, my heart still gets pumping, and I begin to sweat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, AI that appears to engage in novel approaches to problems can be advantageous and in some circumstances such as playing a board game can be right or wrong, for which being wrong does not especially put human lives at stake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor AI-based true self-driving cars, lives are at stake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe’ll need to proceed mindfully and with our eyes wide open about how we want AI driving systems to operate, including calculating odds and deriving choices while at the wheel of the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0\\nhttp://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nEngineers tend to see things in unambiguous terms, which some may call Black and White terms, such as a choice between right or wrong and good and bad.\\xa0The consideration of ethics in AI is highly nuanced, with vast gray areas, making it\\xa0 challenging for AI software engineers to apply it in their work.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat was a takeaway from a session on the Future of Standards and Ethical AI at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0conference held in-person and virtually in Alexandria, Va. this week.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAn overall impression from the conference is that the discussion of AI and ethics is happening in virtually every quarter of AI in the vast enterprise of the federal government, and the consistency of points being made across all these different and independent efforts stood out.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeth-Ann Schuelke-Leech, associate professor, engineering management, University of Windsor\\n“We engineers often think of ethics as a fuzzy thing that no one has really explained,” stated Beth-Anne Schuelke-Leech, an associate professor, Engineering Management and Entrepreneurship at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, speaking at the Future of Ethical AI session. “It can be difficult for engineers looking for solid constraints to be told to be ethical. That becomes really complicated because we don’t know what it really means.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSchuelke-Leech started her career as an engineer, then decided to pursue a PhD in public policy, a background which\\xa0enables\\xa0her to see things as an engineer and as a social scientist. “I got a PhD in social science, and have been pulled back into the engineering world where I am involved in AI projects, but based in a mechanical engineering faculty,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAn engineering project has a goal, which describes the purpose, a set of needed features and functions, and a set of constraints, such as budget and timeline “The standards and regulations become part of the constraints,” she said. “If I know I have to comply with it, I will do that. But if you tell me it’s a good thing to do, I may or may not adopt that.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSchuelke-Leech also serves as chair of the IEEE Society’s Committee on the Social Implications of Technology Standards. She commented, “Voluntary compliance standards such as from the IEEE are essential from people in the industry getting together to say this is what we think we should do as an industry.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome standards, such as around interoperability, do not have the force of law but engineers comply with them, so their systems will work. Other standards are described as good practices, but are not required to be followed. “Whether it helps me to achieve my goal or hinders me getting to the objective, is how the engineer looks at it,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Pursuit of AI Ethics Described as “Messy and Difficult”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSara Jordan, senior counsel, Future of Privacy Forum\\nSara Jordan, senior counsel with the Future of Privacy Forum, in the session with Schuelke-Leech, works on the ethical challenges of AI and machine learning and is an active member of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics and Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. “Ethics is messy and difficult, and is context-laden. We have a proliferation of theories, frameworks and constructs,” she said, adding, “The practice of ethical AI will require repeatable, rigorous thinking in context.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSchuelke-Leech offered, “Ethics is not an end outcome. It is the process being followed. But I’m also looking for someone to tell me what I need to do to do my job, to tell me how to be ethical, what rules I’m supposed to follow, to take away the ambiguity.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Engineers shut down when you get into funny words that they don’t understand, like ‘ontological,’ They’ve been taking math and science since they were 13-years-old,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe has found it difficult to get engineers involved in attempts to draft standards for ethical AI. “Engineers are missing from the table,” she said. “The debates about whether we can get to 100%\\xa0ethical are\\xa0conversations\\xa0engineers do not have.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe concluded, “If their managers tell them to figure it out, they will do so. We need to help the engineers cross the bridge halfway. It is essential that social scientists and engineers don’t give up on this.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLeader’s Panel Described Integration of Ethics into AI Development Practices\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe topic of ethics in AI is coming up more in the curriculum of the US Naval War College of Newport, R.I., which was established to provide advanced study for US Navy officers and now educates leaders from all services. Ross Coffey, a military professor of National Security Affairs at the institution, participated in a Leader’s Panel on AI, Ethics and Smart Policy at AI World Government.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The ethical literacy of students increases over time as they are working with these ethical issues, which is why it is an urgent matter because it will take a long time,” Coffey said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel member Carole Smith, a senior research scientist with Carnegie Mellon University who\\xa0studies human-machine interaction, has been involved in integrating ethics into AI systems development since 2015. She cited the importance of “demystifying” AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“My interest is in understanding what kind of interactions we can create where the human is appropriately trusting the system they are working with, not over- or under-trusting it,” she said, adding, “In general, people have higher expectations than they should for the systems.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs an example, she cited the Tesla Autopilot features, which implement self-driving car capability to a degree but not completely. “People assume the system can do a much broader set of activities than it was designed to do. Helping people understand the limitations of a system is important. Everyone needs to understand the expected outcomes of a system and what some of the mitigating circumstances might be,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel member Taka Ariga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, sees a gap in AI literacy for the young workforce coming into the federal government.\\xa0 “Data scientist training does not always include ethics. Accountable AI is a laudable construct, but I’m not sure everyone buys into it. We need their responsibility to go beyond technical aspects and be accountable to the end user we are trying to serve,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel moderator Alison Brooks, PhD, research VP of Smart Cities and Communities at the IDC market research firm, asked whether principles of ethical AI can be shared across the boundaries of nations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We will have a limited ability for every nation to align on the same exact approach, but we will have to align in some ways on what we will not allow AI to do, and what people will also be responsible for,” stated Smith of CMU.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe panelists credited the European Commission for being out front on these issues of ethics, especially in the enforcement realm.\\xa0\\nRoss of the Naval War Colleges acknowledged the importance of finding common ground around AI ethics. “From a military perspective, our interoperability needs to go to a whole new level. We need to find common ground with our partners and our allies on what we will allow AI to do and what we will not allow AI to do.” Unfortunately, “I don’t know if that discussion is happening,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDiscussion on AI ethics could perhaps be pursued as part of certain existing treaties, Smith suggested\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe many AI ethics principles, frameworks,\\xa0and road maps being offered in many federal agencies can be challenging to follow and be made consistent. Take said, “I am hopeful that over the next year or two, we will see a\\xa0coalescing.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more information and access to recorded sessions, go to\\xa0AI World Government.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI is more accessible to young people in the workforce who grew up as ‘digital natives’ with Alexa and self-driving cars as part of the landscape, giving them expectations grounded in their experience of what is possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat idea set the foundation for a panel discussion at\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0on Mindset Needs and Skill Set Myths for AI engineering teams, held this week virtually and in-person in Alexandria, Va.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer, National Science Foundation\\n“People feel that AI is within their grasp because the technology is available, but the technology is ahead of our cultural maturity,” said panel member Dorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer for the National Science Foundation. “It’s like giving a sharp object to a child. We might have access to big data, but it might not be the right thing to do,” to work with it in all cases.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThings are accelerating, which is raising expectations. When panel member Vivek Rao, lecturer and researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, was working on his PhD, a paper on natural language processing might be a master’s thesis. “Now we assign it as a homework assignment with a two-day turnaround. We have an enormous amount of compute power that was not available even two years ago,”\\xa0he said of his students, who he described as “digital natives”\\xa0with high expectations of what AI makes possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRachel\\xa0Dzombak, digital transformation lead, Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University\\nPanel moderator Rachel\\xa0Dzombak, digital transformation lead at the\\xa0Software Engineering Institute\\xa0of Carnegie Mellon University, asked the panelists what is unique about working on AI in the government.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAronson said the government cannot get too far ahead with the technology, or the users will not know how to interact with it. “We’re not building iPhones,” she said. “We have experimentation going on, and we are always looking ahead, anticipating the future, so we can make the most cost-effective decisions. In the government right now, we are seeing the convergence of the emerging generation and the close-to-retiring generation, who we also have to serve.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEarly in her career, Aronson did not want to work in the government. “I thought it meant you were either in the armed services or the Peace Corps,” she said. “But what I learned after a while is what motivates federal employees is service to larger, problem-solving institutions. We are trying to solve really big problems of equity and diversity, and getting food to people and keeping people safe. People that work for the government are dedicated to those missions.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe referred to her two children in their 20s, who like the idea of service, but in “tiny chunks,” meaning, “They don’t look at the government as a place where they have freedom, and they can do whatever they want. They see it as a lockdown situation. But it’s really not.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBerkeley Students Learn About Role of Government in Disaster Response\\xa0\\xa0\\nRao of Berkeley said his students are seeing wildfires in California and asking who is working on the challenge of doing something about them. When he tells them it is almost always local, state and federal government entities, “Students are generally surprised to find that out.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn one example, he developed a course on innovation in disaster response, in collaboration with CMU and the Department of Defense, the Army Futures Lab and Coast Guard search and rescue. “This was eye-opening for students,” he said. At the outset, two of 35 students expressed interest in a federal government career. By the end of the course, 10 of the 35 students were expressing interest. One of them was hired by the Naval Surface Warfare Center outside Corona, Calif. as a software engineer, Rao said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAronson described the process of bringing on new federal employees as a “heavy lift,” suggesting, “if we could prepare in advance, it would move a lot faster.”\\xa0\\nBryan Lane, director of Data &\\xa0AI,\\xa0General\\xa0Services Administration\\nAsked by\\xa0Dzombak\\xa0what skill sets and mindsets are seen as essential to AI engineering teams, panel member Bryan Lane, director of Data & AI at the General Services Administration (who announced during the session that he is taking on a new role at FDIC), said resiliency is a necessary quality.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane is a technology executive within the GSA IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoE) with over 15 years of experience leading advanced analytics and technology initiatives. He has led the GSA partnership with the DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).\\xa0[Ed. Note: Known as “the Jake.”]\\xa0Lane also is the founder of\\xa0DATA XD.\\xa0He also has experience in industry, managing acquisition portfolios.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The most important thing about resilient teams going on an AI journey is that you need to be ready for the unexpected, and the mission persists,” he said.\\xa0“If you are all aligned on the importance of the mission, the team can be held together.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nGood Sign that Team Members Acknowledge Having “Never Done This Before”\\xa0\\xa0\\nRegarding mindset, he said more of his team members are coming to him and saying, “I’ve never done this before.” He sees that as a good sign that offers an opportunity to talk about risk and alternative solutions. “When your team has the psychological safety to say that they don’t know something,” Lane sees it as positive. “The focus is always on what you have done and what you have delivered. Rarely is the focus on what you have not done before and what you want to grow into,” he said,\\xa0\\xa0\\nAronson has found it challenging to get AI projects off the ground. “It’s hard to tell management that you have a use case or problem to solve and want to go at it, and there is a 50-50 chance it will get done, and you don’t know how much it’s going to cost,” she said. “It comes down to articulating the rationale and convincing others it’s the right thing to do to move forward.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nRao said he talks to students about experimentation and having an experimental mindset. “AI tools can be easily accessible, but they can mask the challenges you can encounter. When you apply the vision API, for example in the context of challenges in your business or government agency, things may not be smooth,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nModerator\\xa0Dzombak\\xa0asked the panelists how they build teams. Arson said, “You need a mix of people.” She has tried “communities of practice” around solving specific problems, where people can come and go. “You bring people together around a problem and not a tool,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane seconded this. “I really have stopped focusing on tools in general,” he said. He ran experiments at JAIC in accounting, finance and other areas. “We found it’s not really about the tools. It’s about getting the right people together to understand the problems, then looking at the tools available,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane said he sets up “cross-functional teams” that are “a little more formal than a community of interest.”\\xa0He has found them to be effective for working together on a problem for maybe 45 days. He also likes working with customers of the needed services inside the organization, and has seen customers learn about data management and AI as a result. “We will pick up one or two along the way who become advocates for accelerating AI throughout the organization,” Lane said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane sees it taking five years to work out proven methods of thinking, working,\\xa0and best practices for developing AI systems to serve the government. He mentioned\\xa0The Opportunity Project\\xa0(TOP) of the US Census Bureau, begun in 2016 to work on challenges such as ocean plastic pollution, COVID-19 economic recovery and disaster response. TOP has engaged in over 135 public-facing projects in that time, and has over 1,300 alumni including developers, designers, community leaders, data and policy experts, students and government agencies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s based on a way of thinking and how to organize work,” Lane said. “We have to scale the model of delivery, but five years from now, we will have enough proof of concept to know what works and what does not.”\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government, at the\\xa0Software Engineering Institute, at\\xa0DATA XD\\xa0and at\\xa0The Opportunity Project.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By\\xa0John P. Desmond,\\xa0AI Trends\\xa0Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTwo experiences of how AI developers within the federal government are pursuing AI accountability practices were outlined at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0event held virtually and in-person this week in Alexandria, Va.\\xa0\\nTaka Ariga, chief data scientist and director, US\\xa0Government Accountability Office\\nTaka Ariga, chief data scientist and director at the US\\xa0Government Accountability Office,\\xa0described an AI accountability framework he uses within his agency and plans to make available to others.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd Bryce\\xa0Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning at the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit\\xa0(DIU), a unit of the Department of Defense founded to help the US military make faster use of emerging commercial technologies, described work in his unit to apply principles of AI development to terminology that an engineer can apply.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAriga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, discussed an\\xa0AI Accountability Framework\\xa0he helped to develop by convening a forum of experts in the government, industry, nonprofits, as well as federal inspector general officials and AI experts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We are adopting an auditor’s perspective on the AI accountability framework,” Ariga said. “GAO is in the business of verification.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe effort to produce a formal framework began in September 2020 and included 60%\\xa0women, 40%\\xa0of whom were underrepresented minorities, to discuss over two days. The effort was spurred by a desire to ground the AI accountability framework in the reality of an engineer’s day-to-day work. The resulting framework was first published in June as what Ariga described as “version 1.0.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSeeking to Bring a “High-Altitude Posture” Down to Earth\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We found the AI accountability framework had a very high-altitude posture,” Ariga said. “These are laudable ideals and aspirations, but what do they mean to the day-to-day AI practitioner? There is a gap, while we see AI proliferating across the government.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We landed on a lifecycle approach,” which steps through stages of design, development, deployment and continuous monitoring. The development effort stands on four “pillars” of Governance, Data, Monitoring and Performance.\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance reviews what the organization has put in place to oversee the AI efforts. “The chief AI officer might be in place, but what does it mean? Can the person make changes? Is it multidisciplinary?”\\xa0 At a system level within this pillar, the team will review individual AI models to see if they were “purposely deliberated.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the Data pillar,\\xa0his team will examine how the training data was evaluated, how representative it is, and is it functioning as intended.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the Performance pillar, the team will consider the “societal impact” the AI system will have in deployment, including whether it risks a violation of the Civil Rights Act. “Auditors have a long-standing track record of evaluating equity. We grounded the evaluation of AI to a proven system,” Ariga said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEmphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring, he said, “AI is not a technology you deploy and forget.” he said. “We are preparing to continually monitor for model drift and the fragility of algorithms, and we are scaling the AI appropriately.” The evaluations will determine whether the AI system continues to meet the need “or whether a sunset is more appropriate,” Ariga said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe is part of the discussion with NIST on an overall government AI accountability framework. “We don’t want an ecosystem of confusion,” Ariga said. “We want a whole-government approach. We feel that this is a useful first step in pushing high-level ideas down to an altitude meaningful to the practitioners of AI.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nDIU Assesses Whether Proposed Projects Meet Ethical AI Guidelines\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryce Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning, the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit\\nAt the DIU, Goodman is involved in a similar effort to develop guidelines for developers of AI projects within the government.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProjects Goodman has been involved with implementation of AI for humanitarian assistance and disaster response, predictive maintenance,\\xa0to\\xa0counter-disinformation,\\xa0and predictive health. He heads the Responsible AI Working Group. He is a faculty member of Singularity University, has a wide range of consulting clients from inside and outside the government, and holds a PhD in AI and Philosophy from the University of Oxford.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe DOD in February 2020 adopted five areas of\\xa0Ethical Principles for AI\\xa0after 15 months of consulting with AI experts in commercial industry, government academia and the American public.\\xa0 These areas are: Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable and Governable.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Those are well-conceived, but it’s not obvious to an engineer how to translate them into a specific project requirement,” Good said in a presentation on Responsible AI Guidelines at the AI World Government event. “That’s the gap we are trying to fill.”\\xa0\\nBefore the DIU even considers a project, they run through the ethical principles to see if it passes muster. Not all projects do. “There needs to be an option to say the technology is not there or the problem is not compatible with AI,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll project stakeholders, including from commercial vendors and within the government, need to be able to test and validate and go beyond minimum legal requirements to meet the principles. “The law is not moving as fast as AI, which is why these principles are important,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlso, collaboration is going on across the government to ensure values are being preserved and maintained. “Our intention with these guidelines is not to try to achieve perfection, but to avoid catastrophic consequences,” Goodman said. “It can be difficult to get a group to agree on what the best outcome is, but it’s easier to get the group to agree on what the worst-case outcome is.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe DIU guidelines along with case studies and supplemental materials will be published on the DIU website “soon,” Goodman said, to help others leverage the experience.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere are Questions DIU Asks Before Development Starts\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe first step in the guidelines is to define the task.\\xa0 “That’s the single most important question,” he said. “Only if there is an advantage, should you use AI.”\\xa0\\nNext is a benchmark, which needs to be set up front to know if the project\\xa0has delivered.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, he evaluates ownership of the candidate data. “Data is critical to the AI system and is the place where a lot of problems can exist.” Goodman said. “We need a certain contract on who owns the data. If ambiguous, this can lead to problems.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, Goodman’s team wants a sample of data to evaluate. Then, they need to know how and why the information was collected. “If consent was given for one purpose, we cannot use it for another purpose without re-obtaining consent,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, the team asks if the responsible stakeholders are identified, such as pilots who could be affected if a component fails.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, the responsible mission-holders must be identified. “We need a single individual for this,” Goodman said. “Often we have a tradeoff between the performance of an algorithm and its\\xa0explainability. We might have to decide between the two. Those kinds of decisions have an ethical component and an operational component. So we need to have someone who is accountable for those decisions, which is consistent with the chain of command in the DOD.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFinally, the DIU team requires a process for rolling back if things go wrong. “We need to be cautious about abandoning the previous system,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce all these questions are answered in a satisfactory way, the team moves on to the development phase.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn lessons learned, Goodman said, “Metrics are key. And simply measuring accuracy might not be adequate. We need to be able to measure success.”\\xa0\\nAlso, fit the technology to the task. “High risk applications require low-risk technology. And when potential harm is significant, we need to have high confidence in the technology,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother lesson learned is to set expectations with commercial vendors. “We need vendors to be transparent,” he said. ”When someone says they have a proprietary algorithm they cannot tell us about, we are very wary. We view the relationship as a collaboration. It’s the only way we can ensure\\xa0that the AI\\xa0is developed responsibly.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLastly, “AI is not magic. It will not solve everything. It should only be used when necessary and only when we can prove it will provide an advantage.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government, at the\\xa0Government Accountability Office,\\xa0at the\\xa0AI Accountability Framework\\xa0and at the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit\\xa0site.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdvances in the AI behind speech recognition are driving growth in the market, attracting venture capital and funding startups, posing challenges to established players.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe growing acceptance and use of speech recognition devices are driving the market, which according to an estimate by Meticulous Research is expected to reach $26.8 billion globally by 2025, according to a recent account in\\xa0Analytics Insight. Better speed and accuracy are among the benefits of the evolving technology.\\xa0\\nDylan Fox, CEO and Founder,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\nOne company in the throes of this new growth,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\xa0of San Francisco, is offering an API for speech recognition capable of transcribing videos, podcasts, phone calls,\\xa0and remote meetings. The company was founded by CEO Dylan Fox in 2017 and has received backing from Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, as well as NVIDIA.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFox has an unusual background for a high tech entrepreneur. He is a graduate of George Washington University with a degree in business administration, business economics,\\xa0and public policy. He got a job as a software engineer for machine learning in the emerging product lab of Cisco in San Francisco, working on deep neural networks and machine learning. He got the idea for\\xa0AssemblyAi\\xa0and attracted capital from Y Combinator, which enabled him to hire data scientists and data engineers to get the technology off the ground.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked in an interview with\\xa0AI Trends\\xa0how he made this transition from undergrad in business administration and economics to high-tech entrepreneur, Fox said, “I taught myself how to program, which led me to a path of machine learning. I was looking for a harder software challenge, which led to natural language processing, which took me to Cisco.” They were working on Siri for the Enterprise for Apple at the time,\\xa0\\nTo speed up the work, Cisco was looking to acquire speech recognition software; Fox was in the catbird’s seat for the search. “We looked at Nuance,” for example, acknowledged as a market leader and owner of more speech recognition software than its competitors. (The acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft for $19.6 billion is expected to be finalized by year-end.) The young, budding entrepreneur was not impressed. “It was crazy how bad all the options were from an accuracy and a developer point of view,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe was impressed by Twilio, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2008, which that year released the Twilio Voice API to make and receive phone calls hosted in the cloud. The company has since raised $103 million in venture capital. “They were setting new standards for a good API for developers,” Fox said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFox’s idea was to use AI and machine learning to achieve “super accurate results, and make it easy for developers to incorporate the API into their products. One customer is\\xa0CallRail, offering call tracking and marketing analytics software, which plans to incorporate\\xa0AssembyAI’s\\xa0API to gain insight into why people are calling. Other customers include NBC and the Wall Street\\xa0Journal, using the product to transcribe content and interviews, and provide closed captioning.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’ve been working on building as close to human speech recognition quality as possible. It’s been a lot of work” Fox said. He expects to reach that plateau in 2022.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe targets companies incorporating speech recognition into their products and makes it easy to buy. Customers pay on a usage basis; for every second of audio transcribed,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\xa0charges a fraction of a penny. Clients get billed monthly. If a customer uses 10 hours a month, it costs about nine dollars. If a customer uses a million hours a month, it costs about $900,000.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoice recognition is a hot market. “Many new startups are being launched,” Fox said, providing opportunity. “Many interesting new businesses are being built on voice data.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssemblyAI’s\\xa0product can detect sensitive topics such as hate speech and profanity, so customers can save on human content moderation.\\xa0\\nAsked to describe what differentiates his technology, Fox said, “We are an experienced team of deep learning researchers,” with experience from companies including BMW, Apple,\\xa0and Facebook. “We build very large, very accurate deep learning models that have recognition results far more accurate than a traditional machine learning approach. We build really large models using advanced neural network technologies.” He compared the approach to what\\xa0OpenAI\\xa0uses to develop its GPT-3 large language model.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn addition, they build AI features on top of the transcriptions, to provide summaries of audio and video content, which can be searched and indexed. “It goes beyond just transcription,” Fox said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe company currently has 25 employees and expects to double in about four months. Business has been good. “There is an explosion of audio and video data online and customers want to be able to take advantage of it, so we see a lot of demand,” Fox said.\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AssemblyAI.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAre there things that we must not know?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is an age-old question.\\xa0Some assert that there is the potential for knowledge that ought to not be known. In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall. The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous. It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming.\\xa0The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all. Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects. It is just plain bad.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed. This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.\\xa0\\nA contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt\\xa0exemplar\\xa0of the problems associated with knowledge. Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device. In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category. This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered. Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first. In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nRound and round we can go.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.\\xa0\\nThe alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful. Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent. Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s the rub.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think. There are two major potential gotchas.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things. If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.\\xa0\\nSecondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms. It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPlenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and then exploitation of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware that many would scoff at this allegation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes potential forbidden knowledge. The technology and technological elements are relatively ho-hum, they would argue. You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the ballpark of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\nFor those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that path. Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at the next turn.\\xa0\\nOne area where AI is being actively used is to create Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).\\xa0\\nWe are gradually seeing the emergence of self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships, self-driving submersibles, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nToday’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent of AI-based, true self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s an intriguing question that has arisen:\\xa0Might the crafting of AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBefore jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when referring to true self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Forbidden Knowledge\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll occupants will be passengers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars. Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGenerally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5. To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNot everyone would agree with that assumption. Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4. Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley. An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end. In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5. Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside. In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\nTo some, this seems\\xa0farfetched.\\xa0\\nThey would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s their logic. Humans are able to drive cars. Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car. Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSeems like pretty ironclad logic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning. With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us. When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAttempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon). Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too. It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge. On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern. The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge. Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge formulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWow, that’s quite a bit of pondering, contemplation, and (some would say) wild thinking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe so, but it is a consideration that some would wish that we gave at least some credence toward and devoted attention to. There is the angst that we might find ourselves by happenstance stumbling into forbidden knowledge on these voracious self-driving cars quests.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor however you might emphasize that having AI-based true self-driving cars will be a potential blessing, proffering mobility-for-all and leading to reducing the number of car crash-related fatalities, there is a sneaking suspicion that it will not be all-good. The catch or trap could be that there is some kind of forbidden knowledge that will get brought to the eye and we will inevitably kick ourselves that we didn’t see it coming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next time you are munching on a delicious apple, give some thought to whether self-driving cars might be forbidden fruit.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe are on the path to taking a big bite, and we’ll have to see where that takes us.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0\\nhttp://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

              "'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\nThe AI stack defined by Carnegie Mellon University is fundamental to the approach being taken by the US Army for its AI development platform efforts, according to Isaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist at the US Army AI Integration Center, speaking at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0event held in-person and virtually from Alexandria, Va., last week.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIsaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist, US Army AI Integration Center\\n“If we want to move the Army from legacy systems through digital modernization, one of the biggest issues I have found is the difficulty in abstracting away the differences in applications,” he said. “The most important part of digital transformation is the middle layer, the platform that makes it easier to be on the cloud or on a local computer.” The desire is to be able to move your software platform to another platform, with the same ease\\xa0with\\xa0which a new smartphone carries over the user’s contacts and histories.\\xa0\\xa0\\nEthics cuts across all layers of the AI application stack, which positions the planning stage at the top, followed by decision support, modeling, machine learning, massive data management and the device layer or platform at the bottom.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I am advocating that we think of the stack as a core infrastructure and a way for applications to be deployed and not to be siloed in our approach,” he said. “We need to create a development environment for a globally-distributed workforce.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Army has been working on a Common Operating Environment Software (Coes) platform, first announced in 2017, a design for DOD work that is scalable, agile, modular, portable and open. “It is suitable for a broad range of AI projects,” Faber said. For executing the effort, “The devil is in the details,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Army is working with CMU and private companies on a prototype platform, including with\\xa0Visimo\\xa0of Coraopolis, Pa., which offers AI development services. Faber said he prefers to collaborate and coordinate with private industry rather than buying products off the shelf. “The problem with that is, you are stuck with the value you are being provided by that one vendor, which is usually not designed for the challenges of DOD networks,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nArmy Trains a Range of Tech Teams in AI\\xa0\\nThe Army engages in AI workforce development efforts for several teams, including:\\xa0 leadership, professionals with graduate degrees; technical staff, which is put through training to get certified; and AI users.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTech teams in the Army have different areas of focus include: general purpose software development, operational data science, deployment which includes analytics, and a machine learning operations team, such as a large team required to build a computer vision system. “As folks come through the workforce, they need a place to collaborate, build and share,” Faber said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTypes of projects include diagnostic, which might be combining streams of historical data, predictive and prescriptive, which recommends a course of action based on a prediction. “At the far end is AI; you don’t start with that,” said Faber. The developer has to solve three problems: data engineering, the AI development platform, which he called “the green bubble,” and the deployment platform, which he called “the red bubble.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“These are mutually exclusive and all interconnected. Those teams of different people need to programmatically coordinate. Usually a good project team will have people from each of those bubble areas,” he said. “If you have not done this yet, do not try to solve the green bubble problem. It makes no sense to pursue AI until you have an operational need.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked by a participant which group is the most difficult to reach and train, Faber said without hesitation, “The hardest to reach are the executives. They need to learn what the value is to be provided by the AI ecosystem. The biggest challenge is how to communicate that value,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel Discusses AI Use Cases with the Most Potential\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn a panel on Foundations of Emerging AI, moderator Curt Savoie, program director, Global Smart Cities Strategies for IDC, the market research firm, asked what emerging AI use case has the most potential.\\xa0\\xa0\\nJean-Charles Lede, autonomy tech advisor for the US Air Force, Office of Scientific Research, said,” I would point to decision advantages at the edge, supporting pilots and operators, and decisions at the back, for mission and resource planning.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nKrista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor\\nKrista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor, said, “Natural language processing is an opportunity to open the doors to AI in the Department of Labor,” she said. “Ultimately, we are dealing with data on people, programs,\\xa0and organizations.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSavoie asked what are the big risks and dangers the panelists see when implementing AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the General Services Administration (GSA), said in a typical IT organization using traditional software development, the impact of a decision by a developer only goes so far. With AI, “You have to consider the impact on a whole class of people, constituents,\\xa0and stakeholders. With a simple change in algorithms, you could be delaying benefits to millions of people or making incorrect inferences at scale. That’s the most important risk,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe said he asks his contract partners to have “humans in the loop and humans on the loop.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nKinnard seconded this, saying, “We have no intention of removing humans from the loop. It’s really about empowering people to make better decisions.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe emphasized the importance of monitoring the AI models after they are deployed. “Models can drift as the data underlying the changes,” she said. “So you need a level of critical thinking to not only do the task, but to assess whether what the AI model is doing is acceptable.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe added, “We have built out use cases and partnerships across the government to make sure we’re implementing responsible AI. We will never replace people with algorithms.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLede of the Air Force said, “We often have use cases where the data does not exist. We cannot explore 50 years of war data, so we use simulation. The risk is in teaching an algorithm that you have a ‘simulation to real gap’ that is a real risk. You are not sure how the algorithms will map to the real world.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nChaudhry emphasized the importance of a testing strategy for AI systems. He warned of developers “who get enamored with a tool and forget the purpose of the exercise.” He recommended the development manager design in independent verification and validation strategy. “Your testing, that is where you have to focus your energy as a leader. The leader needs an idea in mind, before committing resources, on how they will justify whether the investment was a success.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLede of the Air Force talked about the importance of\\xa0explainability. “I am a technologist. I don’t\\xa0do laws. The ability for the AI function to explain in a way a human can interact with, is important. The AI is a partner that we have a dialogue with, instead of the AI coming up with a conclusion that we have no way of verifying,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government.\\xa0By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdvancing trustworthy AI and machine learning to mitigate agency risk is a priority for the US Department of Energy (DOE), and identifying best practices for implementing AI at scale is a priority for the US General Services Administration (GSA).\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s what attendees learned in two sessions at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0live and virtual event held in Alexandria, Va. last week.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPamela Isom, Director of the AI and Technology Office, DOE\\nPamela Isom, Director of the AI and Technology Office at the DOE, who spoke on Advancing Trustworthy AI and ML Techniques for Mitigating Agency Risks, has been involved in proliferating the use of AI across the agency for several years. With an emphasis on applied AI and data science, she oversees risk mitigation policies and standards and has been involved with applying AI to save lives, fight fraud, and strengthen the cybersecurity infrastructure.\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe emphasized the need for the AI project effort to be part of a strategic portfolio. “My office is there to drive a holistic view on AI and to mitigate risk by bringing us together to address challenges,” she said. The effort is assisted by the DOE’s AI and Technology Office, which is focused on transforming the DOE into a world-leading AI enterprise by accelerating research, development, delivery and the adoption of AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I am telling my organization to be mindful of the fact that you can have tons and tons of data, but it might not be representative,” she said. Her team looks at examples from international partners, industry, academia and other agencies for outcomes “we can trust” from systems incorporating AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We know that AI is disruptive, in trying to do what humans do and do it better,” she said. “It is beyond human capability; it goes beyond data in spreadsheets; it can tell me what I’m going to do next before I contemplate it myself. It’s that powerful,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a result, close attention must be paid to data sources. “AI is vital to the economy and our national security. We need precision; we need algorithms we can trust; we need accuracy. We don’t need biases,” Isom said, adding, “And don’t forget that you need to monitor the output of the models long after they have been deployed.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nExecutive Orders Guide GSA AI Work\\xa0\\nExecutive Order 14028, a detailed set of actions to address the cybersecurity of government agencies, issued in May of this year, and Executive Order 13960, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the Federal government, issued in December 2020, provide valuable guides to her work.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo help manage the risk of AI development and deployment, Isom has produced the AI Risk Management Playbook, which provides guidance around system features and mitigation techniques. It also has a filter for ethical and trustworthy principles which are considered throughout AI lifecycle stages and risk types. Plus, the playbook ties to relevant Executive Orders.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd it provides examples, such as your results came in at 80%\\xa0accuracy, but you wanted 90%. “Something is wrong there,” Isom said, adding, “The playbook helps you look at these types of problems and what you can do to mitigate risk, and what factors you should weigh as you design and build your project.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile internal to DOE at present, the agency is looking into next steps for an external version. “We will share it with other federal agencies soon,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGSA Best Practices for Scaling AI Projects Outlined\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations, AI Center of Excellence (CoE), GSA\\nAnil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the AI Center of Excellence (CoE) of the GSA, who spoke on Best Practices for Implementing AI at Scale, has over 20 years of experience in technology delivery, operations and program management in the defense, intelligence and national security sectors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe mission of the\\xa0CoE\\xa0is to accelerate technology modernization across the government, improve the public experience and increase operational efficiency. “Our business model is to partner with industry subject matter experts to solve problems,” Chaudhry said, adding, “We are not in the business of recreating industry solutions and duplicating them.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0CoE\\xa0is providing recommendations to partner agencies and working with them to implement AI systems as the federal government engages heavily in AI development. “For AI, the government landscape is vast. Every federal agency has some sort of AI project going on right now,” he said, and the maturity of AI experience varies widely across agencies.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTypical use cases he is seeing include having AI focus on increasing speed and efficiency, on cost savings and cost avoidance, on improved response time and increased quality and compliance. As one best practice, he recommended the agencies\\xa0vet their commercial experience\\xa0with the large datasets they will encounter in government.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’re talking petabytes and exabytes here, of structured and unstructured data,” Chaudhry said.\\xa0[Ed. Note: A petabyte is 1,000 terabytes.]\\xa0“Also ask industry partners about their strategies and processes on how they do macro and micro trend analysis, and what their experience has been in the deployment of bots such as in Robotic Process Automation, and how they demonstrate sustainability as a result of drift of data.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe also asks potential industry partners to\\xa0describe the AI talent on their team\\xa0or what talent they can access. If the company is weak on AI talent, Chaudhry would ask, “If you buy something, how will you know you got what you wanted when you have no way of evaluating it?”\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe added, “A best practice in implementing AI is defining how you train your workforce to leverage AI tools, techniques and practices, and to define how you grow and mature your workforce. Access to talent leads to either success or failure in AI projects, especially when it comes to scaling a pilot up to a fully deployed system.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn another best practice, Chaudhry recommended examining the industry partner’s\\xa0access to financial capital.\\xa0“AI is a field where the flow of capital is highly volatile. “You cannot predict or project that you will spend X amount of dollars this year to get where you want to be,” he said, because an AI development team may need to explore another hypothesis, or clean up some data that may not be transparent or is potentially biased. “If you don’t have access to funding, it is a risk your project will fail,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother best practice is\\xa0access to logistical capital, such as the data\\xa0 that sensors collect for an AI IoT system. “AI requires an enormous amount of data that is authoritative and timely. Direct access to that data is critical,” Chaudhry said. He recommended that data sharing agreements\\xa0 be in place with organizations relevant to the AI system. “You might not need it right away, but having access to the data, so you could immediately use it and to have thought through the privacy issues before you need the data, is a good practice for scaling AI programs,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA final best practice is planning of\\xa0physical infrastructure,\\xa0such as data center space. “When you are in a pilot, you need to know how much capacity you need to reserve at your data center, and how many end points you need to manage” when the application scales up, Chaudhry said, adding, “This all ties back to access to capital and all the other best practices.“\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government.\\xa0By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile\\xa0AI in hiring is now widely used for writing job descriptions, screening candidates, and automating interviews, it poses a risk of wide discrimination if not implemented carefully.\\xa0\\nKeith Sonderling, Commissioner, US Equal Opportunity Commission\\nThat was the message from Keith Sonderling, Commissioner with the US Equal Opportunity Commision, speaking at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0event held live and virtually in Alexandria, Va., last week. Sonderling is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit discrimination against job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or\\xa0disability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The thought that AI would become mainstream in HR departments was closer to science fiction two year ago, but the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which AI is being used by employers,” he said. “Virtual recruiting is now here to stay.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt’s a busy time for HR professionals. “The great resignation is leading to the great rehiring, and AI will play a role in that like we have not seen before,” Sonderling said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI has been employed for years in hiring—“It did not happen overnight.”—for tasks including chatting with applications, predicting whether a candidate would take the job, projecting what type of employee they would be and mapping out upskilling and reskilling opportunities. “In short, AI is now making all the decisions once made by HR personnel,” which he did not characterize as good or bad.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Carefully designed and properly used, AI has the potential to make the workplace more fair,” Sonderling said. “But carelessly implemented, AI could discriminate on a scale we have never seen before by an HR professional.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTraining Datasets for AI Models Used for Hiring Need to Reflect Diversity\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is because AI models rely on training data. If the company’s current workforce is used as the basis for training, “It will replicate the status quo. If it’s one gender or one race primarily, it will replicate that,” he said. Conversely, AI can help mitigate risks of hiring bias by race, ethnic background, or disability status. “I want to see AI improve on workplace discrimination,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmazon began building a hiring application in 2014, and found over time that it discriminated against women in its recommendations, because the AI model was trained on a dataset of the company’s own hiring record for the previous 10 years, which was primarily of males. Amazon developers tried to correct it but ultimately scrapped the system in 2017.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFacebook has recently agreed to pay $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the US government that the social media company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules, according to an account from\\xa0Reuters. The case centered on Facebook’s use of what it called its PERM program for labor certification. The government found that Facebook refused to hire American workers for jobs that had been reserved for temporary visa holders under the PERM program.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Excluding people from the hiring pool is a violation,” Sonderling said.\\xa0 If the AI program “withholds the existence of the job opportunity to that\\xa0class, so\\xa0they cannot exercise their rights, or if it downgrades a protected class, it is within our domain,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEmployment assessments, which became more common after World War II, have provided\\xa0 high value to HR managers and with help from AI they have the potential to minimize bias in hiring. “At the same time, they are vulnerable to claims of discrimination, so\\xa0employers\\xa0need to be careful and cannot take a hands-off approach,” Sonderling said. “Inaccurate data will amplify bias in decision-making. Employers must be vigilant against discriminatory outcomes.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe recommended researching solutions from vendors who vet data for risks of bias on the basis of race, sex, and other factors.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne example is from\\xa0HireVue\\xa0of South Jordan, Utah, which has\\xa0built a\\xa0hiring platform predicated on the US Equal Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, designed specifically to mitigate unfair hiring practices, according to an account from\\xa0allWork.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA post on AI ethical principles on its website states in part, “Because\\xa0HireVue\\xa0uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or\\xa0propagation\\xa0of bias against any group or individual. We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible. We also continue to advance our abilities to monitor, detect, and mitigate bias. We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlso, “Our data scientists and IO psychologists build\\xa0HireVue\\xa0Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment’s predictive accuracy. The result is a highly valid, bias-mitigated assessment that helps to enhance human decision making while actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nDr. Ed\\xa0Ikeguchi, CEO,\\xa0AiCure\\nThe issue of bias in datasets used to train AI models is not confined to hiring. Dr. Ed\\xa0Ikeguchi, CEO of\\xa0AiCure, an AI analytics company working in the life sciences industry, stated in a recent account in\\xa0HealthcareITNews, “AI is only as strong as the data it’s fed, and lately that data backbone’s credibility is being increasingly called into question. Today’s AI developers lack access to large, diverse data sets on which to train and validate new tools.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe added, “They often need to leverage open-source datasets, but many of these were trained using computer programmer volunteers, which is a predominantly white population. Because algorithms are often trained on single-origin data samples with limited diversity, when applied in real-world scenarios to a broader population of different races, genders, ages, and more, tech that appeared highly accurate in research may prove unreliable.”\\xa0\\nAlso, “There needs to be an element of governance and peer review for all algorithms, as even the most solid and tested algorithm is bound to have unexpected results arise. An algorithm is never done learning—it must be constantly developed and fed more data to improve.”\\xa0\\nAnd, “As an industry, we need to become more skeptical of AI’s conclusions and encourage transparency in the industry. Companies should readily answer basic questions, such as ‘How was the algorithm trained? On what basis did it draw this conclusion?”\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information at\\xa0AI World Government, from\\xa0Reuters\\xa0and from\\xa0HealthcareITNews.\\xa0By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore companies are successfully exploiting predictive maintenance systems that combine AI and IoT sensors to collect data that anticipates breakdowns and recommends preventive action before break or machines fail, in a demonstration of an AI use case with proven value.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis growth is reflected in optimistic market forecasts. The predictive maintenance market is sized at $6.9 billion today and is projected to grow to $28.2 billion by 2026, according to a report from\\xa0IoT Analytics\\xa0of Hamburg, Germany. The firm\\xa0counts over 280 vendors offering solutions in the market today, projected to grow to over 500 by 2026.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFernando Bruegge, Analyst, IoT Analytics, Hamburg, Germany\\n“This research is a wake-up call to those that claim IoT is failing,” stated analyst Fernando Bruegge, author of the report, adding, “For companies that own industrial assets or sell equipment, now is the time to invest in predictive maintenance-type solutions.” And, “Enterprise technology firms need to prepare to integrate predictive maintenance solutions into their offerings,” Bruegge suggested.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere is a review of some specific experience with predictive maintenance systems that combine AI and IoT sensors.\\xa0\\nAircraft engine manufacturer\\xa0Rolls-Royce\\xa0is\\xa0deploying predictive analytics\\xa0to help reduce the amount of carbon its engines produce, while also optimizing maintenance to help customers keep planes in the air longer, according to a recent account in\\xa0CIO.\\xa0\\nRolls-Royce built an Intelligent Engine platform to monitor engine flight, gathering data on weather conditions and how pilots are flying. Machine learning is applied to the data to customize maintenance regimes for individual engines.\\xa0\\nStuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer, Rolls-Royce\\n“We’re tailoring our maintenance regimes to make sure that we’re optimizing for the life an engine has, not the life the manual says it should have,” stated Stuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer at Rolls-Royce. “It’s truly variable service, looking at each engine as an individual engine.”\\xa0\\nCustomers are seeing less service interruption. “Rolls-Royce has been monitoring engines and charging per hour for at least 20 years,” Hughes stated. “That part of the business isn’t new. But as we’ve evolved, we’ve begun to treat the engine as a singular engine. It’s much more about the personalization of that engine.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nPredictive analytics is being applied in healthcare as well as in the manufacturing industry. Kaiser Permanente, the integrated managed care consortium based in Oakland, Calif. Is using predictive analytics to identify non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients at risk of rapid deterioration.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile non-ICU patients that require unexpected transfers to the ICU constitute less than\\xa04%\\xa0of the total hospital population, they account for 20%\\xa0of all hospital deaths, according to Dr. Gabriel Escobar, research scientist, Division of Research, and regional director, Hospital Operations Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California.\\xa0\\nKaiser Permanente Practicing Predictive Maintenance in Healthcare\\xa0\\nKaiser Permanente developed the Advanced Alert Monitor (AAM) system, leveraging three predictive analytic models to analyze more than 70 factors in a given patient’s electronic health record to generate a composite risk score.\\xa0\\n“The AAM system synthesizes and analyzes vital statistics, lab results, and other variables to generate hourly deterioration risk scores for adult hospital patients in the medical-surgical and transitional care units,” stated Dick Daniels, executive vice president and CIO of Kaiser Permanente in the CIO account. “Remote hospital teams evaluate the risk scores every hour and notify rapid response teams in the hospital when potential deterioration is detected. The rapid response team conducts bedside evaluation of the patient and calibrates the course treatment with the hospitalist.”\\xa0\\nIn advice to other practitioners, Daniels recommended a focus on how the tool will be fit into the workflow of health care teams. “It took us about five years to perform the initial mapping of the electronic medical record backend and develop the predictive models,” Daniels stated. “It then took us another two to three years to transition these models into a live web services application that could be used operationally.”\\xa0\\nIn an example from the food industry, a PepsiCo Frito-Lay plant in Fayetteville, Tenn. is using predictive maintenance successfully, with year-to-date equipment downtime at 0.75%\\xa0and unplanned downtime at 2.88%, according to Carlos Calloway, the site’s reliability engineering manager, in an account in\\xa0PlantServices.\\xa0\\nExamples of monitoring include: vibration readings confirmed by ultrasound helped to prevent a PC combustion blower motor from failing and shutting down the whole potato chip department; infrared analysis of the main pole for the plant’s GES automated warehouse detected a hot fuse holder, which helped to avoid a shutdown of the entire warehouse; and increased acid levels were detected in oil samples from a baked extruder gearbox, indicating oil degradation, which enabled prevention of a shutdown of Cheetos Puffs production.\\xa0\\nThe Frito-Lay plant produces more than 150 million pounds of product per year, including Lays, Ruffles, Cheetos, Doritos, Fritos, and Tostitos.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe types of monitoring include vibration analysis, used on mechanical applications, which is processed with the help of a third-party company which sends alerts to the plant for investigation and resolution.\\xa0Another service partner performs quarterly vibration monitoring on selected equipment. All motor control center rooms and electrical panels are monitored with quarterly infrared analysis, which is also used on electrical equipment, some rotating equipment, and heat exchangers. In addition, the plant has done ultrasonic monitoring for more than 15 years, and it is “kind of like the pride and joy of our site from a predictive standpoint,” stated Calloway.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe plan has a number of products in place from UE Systems of Elmsford, NY, supplier of ultrasonic instruments, hardware and software, and training for predictive maintenance.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLouisiana Alumina Plant Automating Bearing Maintenance\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBearings, which wear over time under varying conditions of weather and temperature in the case of automobiles, are a leading candidate for IoT monitoring and predictive maintenance with AI. The\\xa0Noranda Alumina\\xa0plant in Gramercy, La. is finding a big payoff from its investment in a system to improve the lubrication of bearings in its production equipment.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe system has resulted in a 60%\\xa0decline in bearing changes in the second year of using the new lubrication system, translating to some $900,000 in savings on bearings that did not need to be replaced and avoided downtime.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Four hours of downtime is about $1 million dollars’ worth of lost production,” stated Russell Goodwin, a reliability engineer and millwright instructor at Noranda Alumina, in the\\xa0PlantServices\\xa0account, which was based on presentations at the Leading Reliability 2021 event.\\xa0\\nThe Noranda Alumina plant is the only alumina plant operating in the US.\\xa0“If we shut down, you’ll need to import it,” stated Goodwin. The plant experiences pervasive dust, dirt, and caustic substances, which complicate efforts at improved reliability and maintenance practices.\\xa0\\xa0\\nNoranda Alumina tracks all motors and gearboxes at 1,500 rpm and higher with vibration readings, and most below 1,500 with ultrasound. Ultrasonic monitoring, of sound in ranges beyond human hearing, was introduced to the plant after Goodwin joined the company in 2019. At the time, grease monitoring had room for improvement. “If grease was not visibly coming out of the seal, the mechanical supervisor did not count the round as complete,” stated Goodwin.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAfter introducing automation, the greasing system has improved dramatically, he stated. The system was also able to detect bearings in a belt whose bearings were wearing out too quickly due to contamination. “Tool-enabled tracking helped to prove that it wasn’t improper greasing, but rather the bearing was made improperly,” stated Goodwin.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information in\\xa0\\xa0IoT Analytics,\\xa0in\\xa0CIO\\xa0and in\\xa0PlantServices.\\xa0By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe already\\xa0expect that humans to exhibit flashes of brilliance.\\xa0It might not happen all the time, but the act itself is welcomed and not altogether disturbing when\\xa0it occurs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat about when Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to display an act of novelty?\\xa0Any such instance is bound to get our attention; questions arise right away.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHow did the AI come up with the apparent out-of-the-blue insight or novel indication? Was it a mistake, or did it fit within the parameters of what the AI was expected to produce? There is also the immediate consideration of whether the AI somehow is slipping toward the precipice of becoming sentient.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPlease be aware that no AI system in existence is anywhere close to reaching sentience, despite the\\xa0claims and falsehoods tossed around in the media. As such, if today’s AI seems to do something that appears to be a novel act, you should not leap to the conclusion that this is a sign of human insight within technology or the emergence of human ingenuity among AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s an anthropomorphic bridge too far.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe reality is that any such AI “insightful” novelties are based on various concrete computational algorithms and tangible data-based pattern matching.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn today’s column, we’ll be taking a close look at an example of an AI-powered novel act, illustrated via the game of Go, and relate these facets to the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars as a means of understanding the AI-versus-human related ramifications.\\xa0\\nRealize that the capacity to spot or suggest a novelty is being done methodically by an AI system, while, in contrast, no one can say for sure how humans can devise novel thoughts or intuitions.\\xa0\\nPerhaps we too are bound by some internal mechanistic-like facets, or maybe there is something else going on. Someday, hopefully, we will crack open the secret inner workings of the mind and finally know how we think. I suppose it might undercut the mystery and magical aura that oftentimes goes along with those of us that have moments of outside-the-box visions, though I’d trade that enigma to know how the cups-and-balls trickery truly functions (going behind the curtain, as it were).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of novelty, a famous game match involving the playing of Go can provide useful illumination on this overall topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGo is a popular board game\\xa0in the same complexity category as chess. Arguments are made about which is tougher, chess or Go, but I’m not going to get mired into that morass. For the sake of civil discussion, the key point is that Go is highly complex and requires intense mental concentration especially\\xa0at the\\xa0tournament level.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGenerally, Go consists of trying to capture territory on a standard Go board, consisting of a 19 by 19 grid of intersecting lines. For those of you that have never tried playing Go, the closest similar kind of game might be the connect-the-dots that you played in childhood, which involves grabbing up territory, though Go is magnitudes more involved.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is no need for you to know anything in particular about Go to get the gist of what will be discussed next regarding the act of human novelty and the act of AI novelty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA famous Go competition took place about four years ago that pitted one of the world’s top professional Go players, Lee Sedol, against an AI program that had been crafted to play Go, coined as AlphaGo. There is a riveting documentary about the contest and plenty of write-ups and online videos that have in detail covered the match, including post-game analysis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPut yourself back in time to 2016 and relive what happened.\\xa0\\nMost AI developers did not anticipate that the AI of that time would be proficient enough to beat a top Go player. Sure, AI had already been able to best some top chess players, and thus offered a glimmer of expectation that Go would eventually be equally undertaken, but there weren’t any Go programs that had been able to compete at the pinnacle levels of human Go players. Most expected that it would probably be around the year 2020 or so before the capabilities of AI would be sufficient to compete in world-class Go tournaments.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDeepMind Created AlphaGo Using Deep Learning, Machine Learning\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA small-sized tech company named DeepMind Technologies devised the AlphaGo AI playing system (the firm was later acquired by Google). Using techniques from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the AlphaGo program was being revamped and adjusted right up to the actual tournament, a typical kind of last-ditch developer contortions that many of us have done when trying to get the last bit of added edge into something that is about to be demonstrated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis was a monumental competition that had garnered global interest.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHuman players of Go were doubtful that the AlphaGo program would win. Many AI techies were doubtful that AlphaGo would win. Even the AlphaGo developers were unsure of how well the program would do, including the stay-awake-at-night fears that the AlphaGo program would hit a bug or go into a kind of delusional mode and make outright mistakes and play foolishly.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA million dollars in prize money was put into the pot for the competition. There would be five Go games played, one per day, along with associated rules about taking breaks, etc. Some predicted that Sedol would handily win all five games, doing so without cracking a sweat. AI pundits were clinging to the hope that AlphaGo would win at least one of the five games, and otherwise, present itself as a respectable level of Go player throughout the contest.\\xa0\\nIn the first match, AlphaGo won.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis was pretty much a worldwide shocker. Sedol was taken aback. Lots of Go players were surprised that a computer program could compete and beat someone at Sedol’s level of play. Everyone began to give some street cred to the AlphaGo program and the efforts by the AI developers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTension grew for the next match.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the second game, it was anticipated that Sedol might significantly change his approach to the contest. Perhaps he had been overconfident coming into the competition, some harshly asserted, and the loss of the first game would awaken him to the importance of putting all his concentration into the tournament. Or, possibly he had played as though he was competing with a lesser capable player and thus was not pulling out all the stops to try and win the match.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat happened in the second game?\\xa0\\nTurns out that AlphaGo prevailed, again, and also did something that was seemingly remarkable for those that avidly play Go. On the 37th\\xa0move of the match, the AlphaGo program opted to make placement onto the Go board in a spot that nobody especially anticipated. It was a surprise move, coming partway through a match that otherwise was relatively conventional in the nature of the moves being made by both Sedol and AlphaGo.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the time, in real-time, rampant speculation was that the move was an utter gaffe on the part of the AlphaGo program.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nInstead, it became famous as a novel move, known now as “Move 37” and heralded in Go and used colloquially overall to suggest any instance when AI does something of a novel or unexpected manner.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn the third match, AlphaGo won again, now having successfully beaten Sedol in a 3-out-of-5 winner competition. They\\xa0continued though to\\xa0play a fourth and a fifth game.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDuring the fourth game, things were tight as usual and the match play was going head-to-head (well, head versus AI). Put yourself into the shoes of Sedol. In one sense, he wasn’t just a Go player, he was somehow representing all of humanity (an unfair and misguided viewpoint, but pervasive anyway), and the pressure was on him to win at least one game. Just even one game would be something to hang your hat on, and bolster faith in mankind (again, a nonsensical way to look at it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the seventy-eighth move of the fourth game, Sedol made a so-called “wedge” play that was not conventional and surprised onlookers. The next move by AlphaGo was rotten and diminished the likelihood of a win by the AI system. After additional play, ultimately AlphaGo tossed in the towel and resigned from the match, thus Sedol finally had a win against the AI in his belt. He ended-up losing the fifth game, so AlphaGo won four games, Sedol won one). His move also became famous, generally known as “Move 78” in the lore of Go playing.\\xa0\\nSomething else that is worthwhile to know about involves the overarching strategy that AlphaGo was crafted to utilize.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen you play a game, let’s say connect-the-dots, you can aim to grab as many squares at each moment of play, doing so under the belief that inevitably you will then win by the accumulation of those tactically-oriented successes. Human players of Go are often apt to play that way, as it can be said too of chess players, and nearly any kind of game playing altogether.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother approach involves playing to win, even if only by the thinnest of margins, as long as you win. In that case, you might not be motivated for each tactical move to gain near-term territory or score immediate points, and be willing instead to play a larger scope game per se. The proverbial mantra is that if you are shortsighted, you might win some of the battles, but could eventually lose the war. Therefore, it might be a better strategy to keep your eye on the prize, winning the war, albeit if it means that there are battles and skirmishes to be lost along the way.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe AI developers devised AlphaGo with that kind of macro-perspective underlying how the AI system functioned.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHumans can have an especially hard time choosing at the moment to make a move that might look bad or ill-advised, such as giving up territory, finding themselves to be unable to grit their teeth, and taking a lump or two during play. The embarrassment at the instant is difficult to offset by betting that it is going to ultimately be okay, and you will prevail in the end.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor an AI system, there is no semblance of that kind of sentiment involved, and it is all about calculated odds and probabilities.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow that we’ve covered the legendary Go match, let’s consider some lessons learned about novelty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe “Move 38” made by the AI system was not magical. It was an interesting move, for sure, and the AI developers later indicated that the move was one that the AI had calculated would rarely be undertaken by a human player.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis can be interpreted in two ways (at least).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne interpretation is that a human player would not make that move because humans are right and know that it would be a lousy move.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother interpretation is that humans would not make that move due to a belief that the move is unwise, but this could be a result of the humans insufficiently assessing the ultimate value of the move, in the long-run, and getting caught up in a shorter time frame semblance of play.\\xa0\\nIn this instance, it turned out to be a good move—maybe a brilliant move—and turned the course of the game to the advantage of the AI. Thus, what looked like brilliance was in fact a calculated move that few humans would have imagined as valuable and for which jostled humans to rethink how they think about such matters.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome useful recap lessons:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShowcasing Human Self-Limited Insight.\\xa0When the AI does something seemingly novel, it might be viewed as novel simply because humans have already predetermined what is customary and anything beyond that is blunted by the assumption that it is unworthy or mistaken. You could say that we are mentally trapped by our own drawing of the lines of what is considered as inside versus outside the box.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHumans Exploiting AI For Added Insight. Humans can gainfully assess an AI-powered novelty to potentially re-calibrate human thinking on a given topic, enlarging our understanding via leveraging something that the AI, via its vast calculative capacity, might detect or spot that we have not yet so ascertained. Thus, besides admiring the novelty, we ought to seek to improve our mental prowess by whatever source shines brightly including an AI system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI Novelty Is A Dual-Edged Sword.\\xa0We need to be mindful of all AI systems and their possibility of acting in a novel way, which could be good or could be bad. In the Go game, it worked out well. In other circumstances, the AI exploiting the novelty route might go off the tracks, as it were.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s see how this can be made tangible via exploring the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered a Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at a Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Acts Of Novelty\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could say that the AI is playing a game, a driving game, requiring tactical decision-making and strategic planning, akin to when playing Go or chess, though in this case involving life-or-death matters driving a multi-ton car on our public roadways.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur base assumption is that the AI driving system is going to always take a tried-and-true approach to any driving decisions. This assumption is somewhat shaped around a notion that AI is a type of robot or automata that is bereft of any human biases or human foibles.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn reality, there is no reason to make this kind of assumption. Yes, we can generally rule out the aspect that the AI is not going to display the emotion of a human ilk, and we also know that the AI will not be drunk or DUI in its driving efforts. Nonetheless, if the AI has been trained using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), it can pick up subtleties of human behavioral patterns in the data about human driving, out of which it will likewise utilize or mimic in choosing its driving actions (for example, see my column postings involving an analysis of potential racial biases in AI and the possibility of gender biases).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTurning back to the topic of novelty, let’s ponder a specific use case.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA few years ago, I was driving on an open highway, going at the prevailing speed of around 65 miles per hour, and something nearly unimaginable occurred. A car coming toward me in the opposing lane, and likely traveling at around 60 to 70 miles per hour, suddenly and unexpectedly veered into my lane. It was one of those moments that you cannot anticipate.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere did not appear to be any reason for the other driver to be headed toward me, in my lane of traffic, and coming at me for an imminent and bone-chillingly terrifying head-on collision. If there had been debris on the other lane, it might have been a clue that perhaps this other driver was simply trying to swing around the obstruction. No debris. If there was a slower moving car, the driver might have wanted to do a fast end-around to get past it. Nope, there was absolutely no discernible basis for this radical and life-threatening maneuver.\\xa0\\nWhat would you do?\\xa0\\nCome on, hurry, the clock is ticking, and you have just a handful of split seconds to make a life-or-death driving decision.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could stay in your lane and hope that the other driver realizes the error of their ways, opting to veer back into their lane at the last moment. Or, you could proactively go into the opposing lane, giving the other driver a clear path in your lane, but this could be a chancy game of chicken whereby the other driver chooses to go back into their lane (plus, there was other traffic further behind that driver, so going into the opposing lane was quite dicey).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so do you stay in your lane or veer away into the opposing lane?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI dare say that most people would be torn between those two options. Neither one is palatable.\\xa0\\nSuppose the AI of a self-driving car was faced with the same circumstance.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat would the AI do?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that even if the AI had been fed with thousands upon thousands of miles of driving via a database about human driving while undergoing the ML/DL training, there might not be any instances of a head-to-head nature and thus no prior pattern to utilize for making this onerous decision.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnyway, here’s a twist.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that the AI calculated the probabilities involving which way to go, and in some computational manner came to the conclusion that the self-driving car should go into the ditch that was at the right of the roadway. This was intended to avoid entirely a collision with the other car (the AI estimated that a head-on collision would be near-certain death for the occupants). The AI estimated that going into the ditch at such high speed would indisputably wreck the car and cause great bodily injury to the occupants, but the odds of assured death were (let’s say) calculated as lower than the head-on option possibilities (this is a variant of the infamous Trolley Problem, as covered in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’m betting that you would concede that most humans would be relatively unwilling to aim purposely into that ditch, which they know for sure is going to be a wreck and potential death, while instead willing (reluctantly) to take a hoped-for chance of either veering into the other lane or staying on course and wishing for the best.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn some sense, the AI might seem to have made a novel choice. It is one that (we’ll assume) few humans would have given any explicit thought toward.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nReturning to the earlier recap of the points about AI novelty, you could suggest that in this example, the AI has exceeded a human self-imposed limitation by the AI having considered otherwise “unthinkable” options. From this, perhaps we can learn to broaden our view for options that otherwise don’t seem apparent.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other recap element was that the AI novelty can be a dual-edged sword.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf the AI did react by driving into the ditch, and you were inside the self-driving car, and you got badly injured, would you later believe that the AI acted in a novel manner or that it acted mistakenly or adversely?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome might say that if you lived to ask that question, apparently the AI made the right choice. The counter-argument is that if the AI had gone with one of the other choices, perhaps you would have sailed right past the other car and not gotten a single scratch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor those of you wondering what actually did happen, my lucky stars were looking over me that day, and I survived with nothing more than a close call. I decided to remain in my lane, though it was tempting to veer into the opposing lane, and by some miracle, the other driver suddenly went back into the opposing lane.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen I tell the story, my heart still gets pumping, and I begin to sweat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, AI that appears to engage in novel approaches to problems can be advantageous and in some circumstances such as playing a board game can be right or wrong, for which being wrong does not especially put human lives at stake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor AI-based true self-driving cars, lives are at stake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe’ll need to proceed mindfully and with our eyes wide open about how we want AI driving systems to operate, including calculating odds and deriving choices while at the wheel of the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0\\nhttp://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nEngineers tend to see things in unambiguous terms, which some may call Black and White terms, such as a choice between right or wrong and good and bad.\\xa0The consideration of ethics in AI is highly nuanced, with vast gray areas, making it\\xa0 challenging for AI software engineers to apply it in their work.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat was a takeaway from a session on the Future of Standards and Ethical AI at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0conference held in-person and virtually in Alexandria, Va. this week.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAn overall impression from the conference is that the discussion of AI and ethics is happening in virtually every quarter of AI in the vast enterprise of the federal government, and the consistency of points being made across all these different and independent efforts stood out.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeth-Ann Schuelke-Leech, associate professor, engineering management, University of Windsor\\n“We engineers often think of ethics as a fuzzy thing that no one has really explained,” stated Beth-Anne Schuelke-Leech, an associate professor, Engineering Management and Entrepreneurship at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, speaking at the Future of Ethical AI session. “It can be difficult for engineers looking for solid constraints to be told to be ethical. That becomes really complicated because we don’t know what it really means.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSchuelke-Leech started her career as an engineer, then decided to pursue a PhD in public policy, a background which\\xa0enables\\xa0her to see things as an engineer and as a social scientist. “I got a PhD in social science, and have been pulled back into the engineering world where I am involved in AI projects, but based in a mechanical engineering faculty,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAn engineering project has a goal, which describes the purpose, a set of needed features and functions, and a set of constraints, such as budget and timeline “The standards and regulations become part of the constraints,” she said. “If I know I have to comply with it, I will do that. But if you tell me it’s a good thing to do, I may or may not adopt that.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSchuelke-Leech also serves as chair of the IEEE Society’s Committee on the Social Implications of Technology Standards. She commented, “Voluntary compliance standards such as from the IEEE are essential from people in the industry getting together to say this is what we think we should do as an industry.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome standards, such as around interoperability, do not have the force of law but engineers comply with them, so their systems will work. Other standards are described as good practices, but are not required to be followed. “Whether it helps me to achieve my goal or hinders me getting to the objective, is how the engineer looks at it,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Pursuit of AI Ethics Described as “Messy and Difficult”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSara Jordan, senior counsel, Future of Privacy Forum\\nSara Jordan, senior counsel with the Future of Privacy Forum, in the session with Schuelke-Leech, works on the ethical challenges of AI and machine learning and is an active member of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics and Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. “Ethics is messy and difficult, and is context-laden. We have a proliferation of theories, frameworks and constructs,” she said, adding, “The practice of ethical AI will require repeatable, rigorous thinking in context.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSchuelke-Leech offered, “Ethics is not an end outcome. It is the process being followed. But I’m also looking for someone to tell me what I need to do to do my job, to tell me how to be ethical, what rules I’m supposed to follow, to take away the ambiguity.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Engineers shut down when you get into funny words that they don’t understand, like ‘ontological,’ They’ve been taking math and science since they were 13-years-old,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe has found it difficult to get engineers involved in attempts to draft standards for ethical AI. “Engineers are missing from the table,” she said. “The debates about whether we can get to 100%\\xa0ethical are\\xa0conversations\\xa0engineers do not have.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe concluded, “If their managers tell them to figure it out, they will do so. We need to help the engineers cross the bridge halfway. It is essential that social scientists and engineers don’t give up on this.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLeader’s Panel Described Integration of Ethics into AI Development Practices\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe topic of ethics in AI is coming up more in the curriculum of the US Naval War College of Newport, R.I., which was established to provide advanced study for US Navy officers and now educates leaders from all services. Ross Coffey, a military professor of National Security Affairs at the institution, participated in a Leader’s Panel on AI, Ethics and Smart Policy at AI World Government.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The ethical literacy of students increases over time as they are working with these ethical issues, which is why it is an urgent matter because it will take a long time,” Coffey said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel member Carole Smith, a senior research scientist with Carnegie Mellon University who\\xa0studies human-machine interaction, has been involved in integrating ethics into AI systems development since 2015. She cited the importance of “demystifying” AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“My interest is in understanding what kind of interactions we can create where the human is appropriately trusting the system they are working with, not over- or under-trusting it,” she said, adding, “In general, people have higher expectations than they should for the systems.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs an example, she cited the Tesla Autopilot features, which implement self-driving car capability to a degree but not completely. “People assume the system can do a much broader set of activities than it was designed to do. Helping people understand the limitations of a system is important. Everyone needs to understand the expected outcomes of a system and what some of the mitigating circumstances might be,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel member Taka Ariga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, sees a gap in AI literacy for the young workforce coming into the federal government.\\xa0 “Data scientist training does not always include ethics. Accountable AI is a laudable construct, but I’m not sure everyone buys into it. We need their responsibility to go beyond technical aspects and be accountable to the end user we are trying to serve,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPanel moderator Alison Brooks, PhD, research VP of Smart Cities and Communities at the IDC market research firm, asked whether principles of ethical AI can be shared across the boundaries of nations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We will have a limited ability for every nation to align on the same exact approach, but we will have to align in some ways on what we will not allow AI to do, and what people will also be responsible for,” stated Smith of CMU.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe panelists credited the European Commission for being out front on these issues of ethics, especially in the enforcement realm.\\xa0\\nRoss of the Naval War Colleges acknowledged the importance of finding common ground around AI ethics. “From a military perspective, our interoperability needs to go to a whole new level. We need to find common ground with our partners and our allies on what we will allow AI to do and what we will not allow AI to do.” Unfortunately, “I don’t know if that discussion is happening,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDiscussion on AI ethics could perhaps be pursued as part of certain existing treaties, Smith suggested\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe many AI ethics principles, frameworks,\\xa0and road maps being offered in many federal agencies can be challenging to follow and be made consistent. Take said, “I am hopeful that over the next year or two, we will see a\\xa0coalescing.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more information and access to recorded sessions, go to\\xa0AI World Government.\\xa0By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\nAI is more accessible to young people in the workforce who grew up as ‘digital natives’ with Alexa and self-driving cars as part of the landscape, giving them expectations grounded in their experience of what is possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat idea set the foundation for a panel discussion at\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0on Mindset Needs and Skill Set Myths for AI engineering teams, held this week virtually and in-person in Alexandria, Va.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer, National Science Foundation\\n“People feel that AI is within their grasp because the technology is available, but the technology is ahead of our cultural maturity,” said panel member Dorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer for the National Science Foundation. “It’s like giving a sharp object to a child. We might have access to big data, but it might not be the right thing to do,” to work with it in all cases.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThings are accelerating, which is raising expectations. When panel member Vivek Rao, lecturer and researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, was working on his PhD, a paper on natural language processing might be a master’s thesis. “Now we assign it as a homework assignment with a two-day turnaround. We have an enormous amount of compute power that was not available even two years ago,”\\xa0he said of his students, who he described as “digital natives”\\xa0with high expectations of what AI makes possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRachel\\xa0Dzombak, digital transformation lead, Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University\\nPanel moderator Rachel\\xa0Dzombak, digital transformation lead at the\\xa0Software Engineering Institute\\xa0of Carnegie Mellon University, asked the panelists what is unique about working on AI in the government.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAronson said the government cannot get too far ahead with the technology, or the users will not know how to interact with it. “We’re not building iPhones,” she said. “We have experimentation going on, and we are always looking ahead, anticipating the future, so we can make the most cost-effective decisions. In the government right now, we are seeing the convergence of the emerging generation and the close-to-retiring generation, who we also have to serve.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEarly in her career, Aronson did not want to work in the government. “I thought it meant you were either in the armed services or the Peace Corps,” she said. “But what I learned after a while is what motivates federal employees is service to larger, problem-solving institutions. We are trying to solve really big problems of equity and diversity, and getting food to people and keeping people safe. People that work for the government are dedicated to those missions.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShe referred to her two children in their 20s, who like the idea of service, but in “tiny chunks,” meaning, “They don’t look at the government as a place where they have freedom, and they can do whatever they want. They see it as a lockdown situation. But it’s really not.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBerkeley Students Learn About Role of Government in Disaster Response\\xa0\\xa0\\nRao of Berkeley said his students are seeing wildfires in California and asking who is working on the challenge of doing something about them. When he tells them it is almost always local, state and federal government entities, “Students are generally surprised to find that out.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn one example, he developed a course on innovation in disaster response, in collaboration with CMU and the Department of Defense, the Army Futures Lab and Coast Guard search and rescue. “This was eye-opening for students,” he said. At the outset, two of 35 students expressed interest in a federal government career. By the end of the course, 10 of the 35 students were expressing interest. One of them was hired by the Naval Surface Warfare Center outside Corona, Calif. as a software engineer, Rao said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAronson described the process of bringing on new federal employees as a “heavy lift,” suggesting, “if we could prepare in advance, it would move a lot faster.”\\xa0\\nBryan Lane, director of Data &\\xa0AI,\\xa0General\\xa0Services Administration\\nAsked by\\xa0Dzombak\\xa0what skill sets and mindsets are seen as essential to AI engineering teams, panel member Bryan Lane, director of Data & AI at the General Services Administration (who announced during the session that he is taking on a new role at FDIC), said resiliency is a necessary quality.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane is a technology executive within the GSA IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoE) with over 15 years of experience leading advanced analytics and technology initiatives. He has led the GSA partnership with the DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).\\xa0[Ed. Note: Known as “the Jake.”]\\xa0Lane also is the founder of\\xa0DATA XD.\\xa0He also has experience in industry, managing acquisition portfolios.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The most important thing about resilient teams going on an AI journey is that you need to be ready for the unexpected, and the mission persists,” he said.\\xa0“If you are all aligned on the importance of the mission, the team can be held together.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nGood Sign that Team Members Acknowledge Having “Never Done This Before”\\xa0\\xa0\\nRegarding mindset, he said more of his team members are coming to him and saying, “I’ve never done this before.” He sees that as a good sign that offers an opportunity to talk about risk and alternative solutions. “When your team has the psychological safety to say that they don’t know something,” Lane sees it as positive. “The focus is always on what you have done and what you have delivered. Rarely is the focus on what you have not done before and what you want to grow into,” he said,\\xa0\\xa0\\nAronson has found it challenging to get AI projects off the ground. “It’s hard to tell management that you have a use case or problem to solve and want to go at it, and there is a 50-50 chance it will get done, and you don’t know how much it’s going to cost,” she said. “It comes down to articulating the rationale and convincing others it’s the right thing to do to move forward.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nRao said he talks to students about experimentation and having an experimental mindset. “AI tools can be easily accessible, but they can mask the challenges you can encounter. When you apply the vision API, for example in the context of challenges in your business or government agency, things may not be smooth,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nModerator\\xa0Dzombak\\xa0asked the panelists how they build teams. Arson said, “You need a mix of people.” She has tried “communities of practice” around solving specific problems, where people can come and go. “You bring people together around a problem and not a tool,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane seconded this. “I really have stopped focusing on tools in general,” he said. He ran experiments at JAIC in accounting, finance and other areas. “We found it’s not really about the tools. It’s about getting the right people together to understand the problems, then looking at the tools available,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane said he sets up “cross-functional teams” that are “a little more formal than a community of interest.”\\xa0He has found them to be effective for working together on a problem for maybe 45 days. He also likes working with customers of the needed services inside the organization, and has seen customers learn about data management and AI as a result. “We will pick up one or two along the way who become advocates for accelerating AI throughout the organization,” Lane said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLane sees it taking five years to work out proven methods of thinking, working,\\xa0and best practices for developing AI systems to serve the government. He mentioned\\xa0The Opportunity Project\\xa0(TOP) of the US Census Bureau, begun in 2016 to work on challenges such as ocean plastic pollution, COVID-19 economic recovery and disaster response. TOP has engaged in over 135 public-facing projects in that time, and has over 1,300 alumni including developers, designers, community leaders, data and policy experts, students and government agencies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s based on a way of thinking and how to organize work,” Lane said. “We have to scale the model of delivery, but five years from now, we will have enough proof of concept to know what works and what does not.”\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government, at the\\xa0Software Engineering Institute, at\\xa0DATA XD\\xa0and at\\xa0The Opportunity Project.\\xa0By\\xa0John P. Desmond,\\xa0AI Trends\\xa0Editor\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTwo experiences of how AI developers within the federal government are pursuing AI accountability practices were outlined at the\\xa0AI World Government\\xa0event held virtually and in-person this week in Alexandria, Va.\\xa0\\nTaka Ariga, chief data scientist and director, US\\xa0Government Accountability Office\\nTaka Ariga, chief data scientist and director at the US\\xa0Government Accountability Office,\\xa0described an AI accountability framework he uses within his agency and plans to make available to others.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd Bryce\\xa0Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning at the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit\\xa0(DIU), a unit of the Department of Defense founded to help the US military make faster use of emerging commercial technologies, described work in his unit to apply principles of AI development to terminology that an engineer can apply.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAriga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, discussed an\\xa0AI Accountability Framework\\xa0he helped to develop by convening a forum of experts in the government, industry, nonprofits, as well as federal inspector general officials and AI experts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We are adopting an auditor’s perspective on the AI accountability framework,” Ariga said. “GAO is in the business of verification.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe effort to produce a formal framework began in September 2020 and included 60%\\xa0women, 40%\\xa0of whom were underrepresented minorities, to discuss over two days. The effort was spurred by a desire to ground the AI accountability framework in the reality of an engineer’s day-to-day work. The resulting framework was first published in June as what Ariga described as “version 1.0.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nSeeking to Bring a “High-Altitude Posture” Down to Earth\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We found the AI accountability framework had a very high-altitude posture,” Ariga said. “These are laudable ideals and aspirations, but what do they mean to the day-to-day AI practitioner? There is a gap, while we see AI proliferating across the government.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We landed on a lifecycle approach,” which steps through stages of design, development, deployment and continuous monitoring. The development effort stands on four “pillars” of Governance, Data, Monitoring and Performance.\\xa0\\xa0\\nGovernance reviews what the organization has put in place to oversee the AI efforts. “The chief AI officer might be in place, but what does it mean? Can the person make changes? Is it multidisciplinary?”\\xa0 At a system level within this pillar, the team will review individual AI models to see if they were “purposely deliberated.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the Data pillar,\\xa0his team will examine how the training data was evaluated, how representative it is, and is it functioning as intended.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the Performance pillar, the team will consider the “societal impact” the AI system will have in deployment, including whether it risks a violation of the Civil Rights Act. “Auditors have a long-standing track record of evaluating equity. We grounded the evaluation of AI to a proven system,” Ariga said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEmphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring, he said, “AI is not a technology you deploy and forget.” he said. “We are preparing to continually monitor for model drift and the fragility of algorithms, and we are scaling the AI appropriately.” The evaluations will determine whether the AI system continues to meet the need “or whether a sunset is more appropriate,” Ariga said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe is part of the discussion with NIST on an overall government AI accountability framework. “We don’t want an ecosystem of confusion,” Ariga said. “We want a whole-government approach. We feel that this is a useful first step in pushing high-level ideas down to an altitude meaningful to the practitioners of AI.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nDIU Assesses Whether Proposed Projects Meet Ethical AI Guidelines\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryce Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning, the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit\\nAt the DIU, Goodman is involved in a similar effort to develop guidelines for developers of AI projects within the government.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nProjects Goodman has been involved with implementation of AI for humanitarian assistance and disaster response, predictive maintenance,\\xa0to\\xa0counter-disinformation,\\xa0and predictive health. He heads the Responsible AI Working Group. He is a faculty member of Singularity University, has a wide range of consulting clients from inside and outside the government, and holds a PhD in AI and Philosophy from the University of Oxford.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe DOD in February 2020 adopted five areas of\\xa0Ethical Principles for AI\\xa0after 15 months of consulting with AI experts in commercial industry, government academia and the American public.\\xa0 These areas are: Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable and Governable.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Those are well-conceived, but it’s not obvious to an engineer how to translate them into a specific project requirement,” Good said in a presentation on Responsible AI Guidelines at the AI World Government event. “That’s the gap we are trying to fill.”\\xa0\\nBefore the DIU even considers a project, they run through the ethical principles to see if it passes muster. Not all projects do. “There needs to be an option to say the technology is not there or the problem is not compatible with AI,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll project stakeholders, including from commercial vendors and within the government, need to be able to test and validate and go beyond minimum legal requirements to meet the principles. “The law is not moving as fast as AI, which is why these principles are important,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlso, collaboration is going on across the government to ensure values are being preserved and maintained. “Our intention with these guidelines is not to try to achieve perfection, but to avoid catastrophic consequences,” Goodman said. “It can be difficult to get a group to agree on what the best outcome is, but it’s easier to get the group to agree on what the worst-case outcome is.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe DIU guidelines along with case studies and supplemental materials will be published on the DIU website “soon,” Goodman said, to help others leverage the experience.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere are Questions DIU Asks Before Development Starts\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe first step in the guidelines is to define the task.\\xa0 “That’s the single most important question,” he said. “Only if there is an advantage, should you use AI.”\\xa0\\nNext is a benchmark, which needs to be set up front to know if the project\\xa0has delivered.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, he evaluates ownership of the candidate data. “Data is critical to the AI system and is the place where a lot of problems can exist.” Goodman said. “We need a certain contract on who owns the data. If ambiguous, this can lead to problems.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, Goodman’s team wants a sample of data to evaluate. Then, they need to know how and why the information was collected. “If consent was given for one purpose, we cannot use it for another purpose without re-obtaining consent,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, the team asks if the responsible stakeholders are identified, such as pilots who could be affected if a component fails.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNext, the responsible mission-holders must be identified. “We need a single individual for this,” Goodman said. “Often we have a tradeoff between the performance of an algorithm and its\\xa0explainability. We might have to decide between the two. Those kinds of decisions have an ethical component and an operational component. So we need to have someone who is accountable for those decisions, which is consistent with the chain of command in the DOD.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFinally, the DIU team requires a process for rolling back if things go wrong. “We need to be cautious about abandoning the previous system,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce all these questions are answered in a satisfactory way, the team moves on to the development phase.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn lessons learned, Goodman said, “Metrics are key. And simply measuring accuracy might not be adequate. We need to be able to measure success.”\\xa0\\nAlso, fit the technology to the task. “High risk applications require low-risk technology. And when potential harm is significant, we need to have high confidence in the technology,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother lesson learned is to set expectations with commercial vendors. “We need vendors to be transparent,” he said. ”When someone says they have a proprietary algorithm they cannot tell us about, we are very wary. We view the relationship as a collaboration. It’s the only way we can ensure\\xa0that the AI\\xa0is developed responsibly.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLastly, “AI is not magic. It will not solve everything. It should only be used when necessary and only when we can prove it will provide an advantage.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AI World Government, at the\\xa0Government Accountability Office,\\xa0at the\\xa0AI Accountability Framework\\xa0and at the\\xa0Defense Innovation Unit\\xa0site.\\xa0By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\xa0\\nAdvances in the AI behind speech recognition are driving growth in the market, attracting venture capital and funding startups, posing challenges to established players.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe growing acceptance and use of speech recognition devices are driving the market, which according to an estimate by Meticulous Research is expected to reach $26.8 billion globally by 2025, according to a recent account in\\xa0Analytics Insight. Better speed and accuracy are among the benefits of the evolving technology.\\xa0\\nDylan Fox, CEO and Founder,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\nOne company in the throes of this new growth,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\xa0of San Francisco, is offering an API for speech recognition capable of transcribing videos, podcasts, phone calls,\\xa0and remote meetings. The company was founded by CEO Dylan Fox in 2017 and has received backing from Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, as well as NVIDIA.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFox has an unusual background for a high tech entrepreneur. He is a graduate of George Washington University with a degree in business administration, business economics,\\xa0and public policy. He got a job as a software engineer for machine learning in the emerging product lab of Cisco in San Francisco, working on deep neural networks and machine learning. He got the idea for\\xa0AssemblyAi\\xa0and attracted capital from Y Combinator, which enabled him to hire data scientists and data engineers to get the technology off the ground.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked in an interview with\\xa0AI Trends\\xa0how he made this transition from undergrad in business administration and economics to high-tech entrepreneur, Fox said, “I taught myself how to program, which led me to a path of machine learning. I was looking for a harder software challenge, which led to natural language processing, which took me to Cisco.” They were working on Siri for the Enterprise for Apple at the time,\\xa0\\nTo speed up the work, Cisco was looking to acquire speech recognition software; Fox was in the catbird’s seat for the search. “We looked at Nuance,” for example, acknowledged as a market leader and owner of more speech recognition software than its competitors. (The acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft for $19.6 billion is expected to be finalized by year-end.) The young, budding entrepreneur was not impressed. “It was crazy how bad all the options were from an accuracy and a developer point of view,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe was impressed by Twilio, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2008, which that year released the Twilio Voice API to make and receive phone calls hosted in the cloud. The company has since raised $103 million in venture capital. “They were setting new standards for a good API for developers,” Fox said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFox’s idea was to use AI and machine learning to achieve “super accurate results, and make it easy for developers to incorporate the API into their products. One customer is\\xa0CallRail, offering call tracking and marketing analytics software, which plans to incorporate\\xa0AssembyAI’s\\xa0API to gain insight into why people are calling. Other customers include NBC and the Wall Street\\xa0Journal, using the product to transcribe content and interviews, and provide closed captioning.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’ve been working on building as close to human speech recognition quality as possible. It’s been a lot of work” Fox said. He expects to reach that plateau in 2022.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHe targets companies incorporating speech recognition into their products and makes it easy to buy. Customers pay on a usage basis; for every second of audio transcribed,\\xa0AssemblyAI\\xa0charges a fraction of a penny. Clients get billed monthly. If a customer uses 10 hours a month, it costs about nine dollars. If a customer uses a million hours a month, it costs about $900,000.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoice recognition is a hot market. “Many new startups are being launched,” Fox said, providing opportunity. “Many interesting new businesses are being built on voice data.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssemblyAI’s\\xa0product can detect sensitive topics such as hate speech and profanity, so customers can save on human content moderation.\\xa0\\nAsked to describe what differentiates his technology, Fox said, “We are an experienced team of deep learning researchers,” with experience from companies including BMW, Apple,\\xa0and Facebook. “We build very large, very accurate deep learning models that have recognition results far more accurate than a traditional machine learning approach. We build really large models using advanced neural network technologies.” He compared the approach to what\\xa0OpenAI\\xa0uses to develop its GPT-3 large language model.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn addition, they build AI features on top of the transcriptions, to provide summaries of audio and video content, which can be searched and indexed. “It goes beyond just transcription,” Fox said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe company currently has 25 employees and expects to double in about four months. Business has been good. “There is an explosion of audio and video data online and customers want to be able to take advantage of it, so we see a lot of demand,” Fox said.\\xa0\\nLearn more at\\xa0AssemblyAI.\\xa0By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAre there things that we must not know?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is an age-old question.\\xa0Some assert that there is the potential for knowledge that ought to not be known. In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall. The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous. It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming.\\xa0The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all. Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects. It is just plain bad.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed. This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.\\xa0\\nA contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt\\xa0exemplar\\xa0of the problems associated with knowledge. Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device. In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category. This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered. Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first. In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nRound and round we can go.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.\\xa0\\nThe alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful. Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent. Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s the rub.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think. There are two major potential gotchas.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things. If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.\\xa0\\nSecondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms. It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPlenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and then exploitation of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware that many would scoff at this allegation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes potential forbidden knowledge. The technology and technological elements are relatively ho-hum, they would argue. You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the ballpark of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\nFor those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that path. Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at the next turn.\\xa0\\nOne area where AI is being actively used is to create Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).\\xa0\\nWe are gradually seeing the emergence of self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships, self-driving submersibles, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nToday’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent of AI-based, true self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system. There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s an intriguing question that has arisen:\\xa0Might the crafting of AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBefore jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when referring to true self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Forbidden Knowledge\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll occupants will be passengers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars. Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGenerally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5. To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNot everyone would agree with that assumption. Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4. Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley. An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end. In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5. Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside. In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\nTo some, this seems\\xa0farfetched.\\xa0\\nThey would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s their logic. Humans are able to drive cars. Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car. Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSeems like pretty ironclad logic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning. With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us. When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAttempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon). Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too. It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge. On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern. The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge. Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge formulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWow, that’s quite a bit of pondering, contemplation, and (some would say) wild thinking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe so, but it is a consideration that some would wish that we gave at least some credence toward and devoted attention to. There is the angst that we might find ourselves by happenstance stumbling into forbidden knowledge on these voracious self-driving cars quests.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor however you might emphasize that having AI-based true self-driving cars will be a potential blessing, proffering mobility-for-all and leading to reducing the number of car crash-related fatalities, there is a sneaking suspicion that it will not be all-good. The catch or trap could be that there is some kind of forbidden knowledge that will get brought to the eye and we will inevitably kick ourselves that we didn’t see it coming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next time you are munching on a delicious apple, give some thought to whether self-driving cars might be forbidden fruit.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe are on the path to taking a big bite, and we’ll have to see where that takes us.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0\\nhttp://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0'"

              "The AI stack defined by Carnegie Mellon University is fundamental to the approach being taken by the US Army for its AI development platform efforts, according to Isaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist at the US Army AI Integration Center, speaking at the AI World Government event held in-person and virtually from Alexandria, Va., last week.</mark> <mark>Isaac Faber, Chief Data Scientist, US Army AI Integration Center\n",
              "“If we want to move the Army from legacy systems through digital modernization, one of the biggest issues I have found is the difficulty in abstracting away the differences in applications,” he said.</mark> <mark>“The most important part of digital transformation is the middle layer, the platform that makes it easier to be on the cloud or on a local computer.” The desire is to be able to move your software platform to another platform, with the same ease with which a new smartphone carries over the user’s contacts and histories.</mark> <mark>Ethics cuts across all layers of the AI application stack, which positions the planning stage at the top, followed by decision support, modeling, machine learning, massive data management and the device layer or platform at the bottom.</mark> <mark>“I am advocating that we think of the stack as a core infrastructure and a way for applications to be deployed and not to be siloed in our approach,” he said.</mark> <mark>“We need to create a development environment for a globally-distributed workforce.”   \n",
              "The Army has been working on a Common Operating Environment Software (Coes) platform, first announced in 2017, a design for DOD work that is scalable, agile, modular, portable and open.</mark> <mark>“It is suitable for a broad range of AI projects,” Faber said.</mark> For executing the effort, “The devil is in the details,” he said. The Army is working with CMU and private companies on a prototype platform, including with Visimo of Coraopolis, Pa., which offers AI development services. Faber said he prefers to collaborate and coordinate with private industry rather than buying products off the shelf. <mark>“The problem with that is, you are stuck with the value you are being provided by that one vendor, which is usually not designed for the challenges of DOD networks,” he said.</mark> Army Trains a Range of Tech Teams in AI \n",
              "The Army engages in AI workforce development efforts for several teams, including:  leadership, professionals with graduate degrees; technical staff, which is put through training to get certified; and AI users. <mark>Tech teams in the Army have different areas of focus include: general purpose software development, operational data science, deployment which includes analytics, and a machine learning operations team, such as a large team required to build a computer vision system.</mark> <mark>“As folks come through the workforce, they need a place to collaborate, build and share,” Faber said.</mark> Types of projects include diagnostic, which might be combining streams of historical data, predictive and prescriptive, which recommends a course of action based on a prediction. <mark>“At the far end is AI; you don’t start with that,” said Faber.</mark> <mark>The developer has to solve three problems: data engineering, the AI development platform, which he called “the green bubble,” and the deployment platform, which he called “the red bubble.”   \n",
              "“These are mutually exclusive and all interconnected.</mark> Those teams of different people need to programmatically coordinate. <mark>Usually a good project team will have people from each of those bubble areas,” he said.</mark> “If you have not done this yet, do not try to solve the green bubble problem. <mark>It makes no sense to pursue AI until you have an operational need.”   \n",
              "Asked by a participant which group is the most difficult to reach and train, Faber said without hesitation, “The hardest to reach are the executives.</mark> <mark>They need to learn what the value is to be provided by the AI ecosystem.</mark> The biggest challenge is how to communicate that value,” he said. Panel Discusses AI Use Cases with the Most Potential  \n",
              "In a panel on Foundations of Emerging AI, moderator Curt Savoie, program director, Global Smart Cities Strategies for IDC, the market research firm, asked what emerging AI use case has the most potential. <mark>Jean-Charles Lede, autonomy tech advisor for the US Air Force, Office of Scientific Research, said,” I would point to decision advantages at the edge, supporting pilots and operators, and decisions at the back, for mission and resource planning.”   \n",
              "Krista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor\n",
              "Krista Kinnard, Chief of Emerging Technology for the Department of Labor, said, “Natural language processing is an opportunity to open the doors to AI in the Department of Labor,” she said.</mark> <mark>“Ultimately, we are dealing with data on people, programs, and organizations.”    \n",
              "Savoie asked what are the big risks and dangers the panelists see when implementing AI.</mark> <mark>Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the General Services Administration (GSA), said in a typical IT organization using traditional software development, the impact of a decision by a developer only goes so far.</mark> With AI, “You have to consider the impact on a whole class of people, constituents, and stakeholders. With a simple change in algorithms, you could be delaying benefits to millions of people or making incorrect inferences at scale. <mark>That’s the most important risk,” he said.</mark> He said he asks his contract partners to have “humans in the loop and humans on the loop.”   \n",
              "Kinnard seconded this, saying, “We have no intention of removing humans from the loop. <mark>It’s really about empowering people to make better decisions.”   \n",
              "She emphasized the importance of monitoring the AI models after they are deployed.</mark> “Models can drift as the data underlying the changes,” she said. <mark>“So you need a level of critical thinking to not only do the task, but to assess whether what the AI model is doing is acceptable.”   \n",
              "She added, “We have built out use cases and partnerships across the government to make sure we’re implementing responsible AI.</mark> <mark>We will never replace people with algorithms.”  \n",
              "Lede of the Air Force said, “We often have use cases where the data does not exist.</mark> We cannot explore 50 years of war data, so we use simulation. The risk is in teaching an algorithm that you have a ‘simulation to real gap’ that is a real risk. <mark>You are not sure how the algorithms will map to the real world.”  \n",
              "Chaudhry emphasized the importance of a testing strategy for AI systems.</mark> He warned of developers “who get enamored with a tool and forget the purpose of the exercise.” He recommended the development manager design in independent verification and validation strategy. “Your testing, that is where you have to focus your energy as a leader. The leader needs an idea in mind, before committing resources, on how they will justify whether the investment was a success.”   \n",
              "Lede of the Air Force talked about the importance of explainability. “I am a technologist. I don’t do laws. The ability for the AI function to explain in a way a human can interact with, is important. The AI is a partner that we have a dialogue with, instead of the AI coming up with a conclusion that we have no way of verifying,” he said. Learn more at AI World Government. "

              "Pamela Isom, Director of the AI and Technology Office at the DOE, who spoke on Advancing Trustworthy AI and ML Techniques for Mitigating Agency Risks, has been involved in proliferating the use of AI across the agency for several years.</mark> <mark>With an emphasis on applied AI and data science, she oversees risk mitigation policies and standards and has been involved with applying AI to save lives, fight fraud, and strengthen the cybersecurity infrastructure.</mark> <mark>She emphasized the need for the AI project effort to be part of a strategic portfolio.</mark> <mark>“My office is there to drive a holistic view on AI and to mitigate risk by bringing us together to address challenges,” she said.</mark> The effort is assisted by the DOE’s AI and Technology Office, which is focused on transforming the DOE into a world-leading AI enterprise by accelerating research, development, delivery and the adoption of AI. “I am telling my organization to be mindful of the fact that you can have tons and tons of data, but it might not be representative,” she said. <mark>Her team looks at examples from international partners, industry, academia and other agencies for outcomes “we can trust” from systems incorporating AI.</mark> “We know that AI is disruptive, in trying to do what humans do and do it better,” she said. “It is beyond human capability; it goes beyond data in spreadsheets; it can tell me what I’m going to do next before I contemplate it myself. It’s that powerful,” she said. As a result, close attention must be paid to data sources. “AI is vital to the economy and our national security. We need precision; we need algorithms we can trust; we need accuracy. <mark>We don’t need biases,” Isom said, adding, “And don’t forget that you need to monitor the output of the models long after they have been deployed.”   \n",

              "Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations, AI Center of Excellence (CoE), GSA\n",
              "Anil Chaudhry, Director of Federal AI Implementations for the AI Center of Excellence (CoE) of the GSA, who spoke on Best Practices for Implementing AI at Scale, has over 20 years of experience in technology delivery, operations and program management in the defense, intelligence and national security sectors.</mark> The mission of the CoE is to accelerate technology modernization across the government, improve the public experience and increase operational efficiency. <mark>“Our business model is to partner with industry subject matter experts to solve problems,” Chaudhry said, adding, “We are not in the business of recreating industry solutions and duplicating them.”   \n",
              "The CoE is providing recommendations to partner agencies and working with them to implement AI systems as the federal government engages heavily in AI development.</mark> “For AI, the government landscape is vast. <mark>Every federal agency has some sort of AI project going on right now,” he said, and the maturity of AI experience varies widely across agencies.</mark> Typical use cases he is seeing include having AI focus on increasing speed and efficiency, on cost savings and cost avoidance, on improved response time and increased quality and compliance. As one best practice, he recommended the agencies vet their commercial experience with the large datasets they will encounter in government. “We’re talking petabytes and exabytes here, of structured and unstructured data,” Chaudhry said. <mark>[Ed.</mark> <mark>Note: A petabyte is 1,000 terabytes.]</mark> <mark>“Also ask industry partners about their strategies and processes on how they do macro and micro trend analysis, and what their experience has been in the deployment of bots such as in Robotic Process Automation, and how they demonstrate sustainability as a result of drift of data.”   \n",
              "He also asks potential industry partners to describe the AI talent on their team or what talent they can access.</mark> If the company is weak on AI talent, Chaudhry would ask, “If you buy something, how will you know you got what you wanted when you have no way of evaluating it?”  \n",
              "He added, “A best practice in implementing AI is defining how you train your workforce to leverage AI tools, techniques and practices, and to define how you grow and mature your workforce. <mark>Access to talent leads to either success or failure in AI projects, especially when it comes to scaling a pilot up to a fully deployed system.”  \n",
              "In another best practice, Chaudhry recommended examining the industry partner’s access to financial capital.</mark> <mark>“AI is a field where the flow of capital is highly volatile.</mark> <mark>“You cannot predict or project that you will spend X amount of dollars this year to get where you want to be,” he said, because an AI development team may need to explore another hypothesis, or clean up some data that may not be transparent or is potentially biased.</mark> “If you don’t have access to funding, it is a risk your project will fail,” he said. Another best practice is access to logistical capital, such as the data  that sensors collect for an AI IoT system. “AI requires an enormous amount of data that is authoritative and timely. <mark>Direct access to that data is critical,” Chaudhry said.</mark> He recommended that data sharing agreements  be in place with organizations relevant to the AI system. <mark>“You might not need it right away, but having access to the data, so you could immediately use it and to have thought through the privacy issues before you need the data, is a good practice for scaling AI programs,” he said.</mark> A final best practice is planning of physical infrastructure, such as data center space. “When you are in a pilot, you need to know how much capacity you need to reserve at your data center, and how many end points you need to manage” when the application scales up, Chaudhry said, adding, “This all ties back to access to capital and all the other best practices.“ \n",

              "While AI in hiring is now widely used for writing job descriptions, screening candidates, and automating interviews, it poses a risk of wide discrimination if not implemented carefully.</mark> <mark>Keith Sonderling, Commissioner, US Equal Opportunity Commission\n",
              "That was the message from Keith Sonderling, Commissioner with the US Equal Opportunity Commision, speaking at the AI World Government event held live and virtually in Alexandria, Va., last week.</mark> <mark>Sonderling is responsible for enforcing federal laws that prohibit discrimination against job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.</mark> <mark>“The thought that AI would become mainstream in HR departments was closer to science fiction two year ago, but the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which AI is being used by employers,” he said.</mark> <mark>“Virtual recruiting is now here to stay.”  \n",
              "It’s a busy time for HR professionals.</mark> “The great resignation is leading to the great rehiring, and AI will play a role in that like we have not seen before,” Sonderling said. AI has been employed for years in hiring—“It did not happen overnight.”—for tasks including chatting with applications, predicting whether a candidate would take the job, projecting what type of employee they would be and mapping out upskilling and reskilling opportunities. “In short, AI is now making all the decisions once made by HR personnel,” which he did not characterize as good or bad. <mark>“Carefully designed and properly used, AI has the potential to make the workplace more fair,” Sonderling said.</mark> <mark>“But carelessly implemented, AI could discriminate on a scale we have never seen before by an HR professional.”  \n",
              "Training Datasets for AI Models Used for Hiring Need to Reflect Diversity  \n",
              "This is because AI models rely on training data.</mark> <mark>If the company’s current workforce is used as the basis for training, “It will replicate the status quo.</mark> <mark>If it’s one gender or one race primarily, it will replicate that,” he said.</mark> <mark>Conversely, AI can help mitigate risks of hiring bias by race, ethnic background, or disability status.</mark> “I want to see AI improve on workplace discrimination,” he said. Amazon began building a hiring application in 2014, and found over time that it discriminated against women in its recommendations, because the AI model was trained on a dataset of the company’s own hiring record for the previous 10 years, which was primarily of males. Amazon developers tried to correct it but ultimately scrapped the system in 2017. <mark>Facebook has recently agreed to pay $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the US government that the social media company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules, according to an account from Reuters.</mark> <mark>The case centered on Facebook’s use of what it called its PERM program for labor certification.</mark> The government found that Facebook refused to hire American workers for jobs that had been reserved for temporary visa holders under the PERM program. “Excluding people from the hiring pool is a violation,” Sonderling said. If the AI program “withholds the existence of the job opportunity to that class, so they cannot exercise their rights, or if it downgrades a protected class, it is within our domain,” he said. Employment assessments, which became more common after World War II, have provided  high value to HR managers and with help from AI they have the potential to minimize bias in hiring. <mark>“At the same time, they are vulnerable to claims of discrimination, so employers need to be careful and cannot take a hands-off approach,” Sonderling said.</mark> “Inaccurate data will amplify bias in decision-making. Employers must be vigilant against discriminatory outcomes.”  \n",
              "He recommended researching solutions from vendors who vet data for risks of bias on the basis of race, sex, and other factors. One example is from HireVue of South Jordan, Utah, which has built a hiring platform predicated on the US Equal Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, designed specifically to mitigate unfair hiring practices, according to an account from allWork. A post on AI ethical principles on its website states in part, “Because HireVue uses AI technology in our products, we actively work to prevent the introduction or propagation of bias against any group or individual. <mark>We will continue to carefully review the datasets we use in our work and ensure that they are as accurate and diverse as possible.</mark> We also continue to advance our abilities to monitor, detect, and mitigate bias. We strive to build teams from diverse backgrounds with diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to best represent the people our systems serve.”  \n",
              "Also, “Our data scientists and IO psychologists build HireVue Assessment algorithms in a way that removes data from consideration by the algorithm that contributes to adverse impact without significantly impacting the assessment’s predictive accuracy. <mark>The result is a highly valid, bias-mitigated assessment that helps to enhance human decision making while actively promoting diversity and equal opportunity regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, or disability status.”  \n",
              "Dr. Ed Ikeguchi, CEO, AiCure\n",
              "The issue of bias in datasets used to train AI models is not confined to hiring.</mark> <mark>Dr. Ed Ikeguchi, CEO of AiCure, an AI analytics company working in the life sciences industry, stated in a recent account in HealthcareITNews, “AI is only as strong as the data it’s fed, and lately that data backbone’s credibility is being increasingly called into question.</mark> <mark>Today’s AI developers lack access to large, diverse data sets on which to train and validate new tools.”  \n",
              "He added, “They often need to leverage open-source datasets, but many of these were trained using computer programmer volunteers, which is a predominantly white population.</mark> Because algorithms are often trained on single-origin data samples with limited diversity, when applied in real-world scenarios to a broader population of different races, genders, ages, and more, tech that appeared highly accurate in research may prove unreliable.” \n",
              "Also, “There needs to be an element of governance and peer review for all algorithms, as even the most solid and tested algorithm is bound to have unexpected results arise. <mark>An algorithm is never done learning—it must be constantly developed and fed more data to improve.” \n",
              "And, “As an industry, we need to become more skeptical of AI’s conclusions and encourage transparency in the industry.</mark> Companies should readily answer basic questions, such as ‘How was the algorithm trained? On what basis did it draw this conclusion?” \n",

              "“We’re tailoring our maintenance regimes to make sure that we’re optimizing for the life an engine has, not the life the manual says it should have,” stated Stuart Hughes, chief information and digital officer at Rolls-Royce.</mark> <mark>“It’s truly variable service, looking at each engine as an individual engine.” \n",

Is using predictive analytics to identify non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients at risk of rapid deterioration.</mark> While non-ICU patients that require unexpected transfers to the ICU constitute less than 4% of the total hospital population, they account for 20% of all hospital deaths, according to Dr. Gabriel Escobar, research scientist, Division of Research, and regional director, Hospital Operations Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California. <mark>Kaiser Permanente Practicing Predictive Maintenance in Healthcare \n",

All motor control center rooms and electrical panels are monitored with quarterly infrared analysis, which is also used on electrical equipment, some rotating equipment, and heat exchangers. <mark>In addition, the plant has done ultrasonic monitoring for more than 15 years, and it is “kind of like the pride and joy of our site from a predictive standpoint,” stated Calloway.</mark> The plan has a number of products in place from UE Systems of Elmsford, NY, supplier of ultrasonic instruments, hardware and software, and training for predictive maintenance. <mark>Louisiana Alumina Plant Automating Bearing Maintenance   \n",
              "Bearings, which wear over time under varying conditions of weather and temperature in the case of automobiles, are a leading candidate for IoT monitoring and predictive maintenance with AI.</mark> The Noranda Alumina plant in Gramercy, La. is finding a big payoff from its investment in a system to improve the lubrication of bearings in its production equipment. The system has resulted in a 60% decline in bearing changes in the second year of using the new lubrication system, translating to some $900,000 in savings on bearings that did not need to be replaced and avoided downtime. <mark>“Four hours of downtime is about $1 million dollars’ worth of lost production,” stated Russell Goodwin, a reliability engineer and millwright instructor at Noranda Alumina, in the PlantServices account, which was based on presentations at the Leading Reliability 2021 event.</mark> The Noranda Alumina plant is the only alumina plant operating in the US. “If we shut down, you’ll need to import it,” stated Goodwin. The plant experiences pervasive dust, dirt, and caustic substances, which complicate efforts at improved reliability and maintenance practices. Noranda Alumina tracks all motors and gearboxes at 1,500 rpm and higher with vibration readings, and most below 1,500 with ultrasound. Ultrasonic monitoring, of sound in ranges beyond human hearing, was introduced to the plant after Goodwin joined the company in 2019. At the time, grease monitoring had room for improvement. “If grease was not visibly coming out of the seal, the mechanical supervisor did not count the round as complete,” stated Goodwin. After introducing automation, the greasing system has improved dramatically, he stated. The system was also able to detect bearings in a belt whose bearings were wearing out too quickly due to contamination. “Tool-enabled tracking helped to prove that it wasn’t improper greasing, but rather the bearing was made improperly,” stated Goodwin. <mark>Read the source articles and information in  IoT Analytics, in CIO and in PlantServices.</mark> "

              "  <mark>By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider  \n",
              "We already expect that humans to exhibit flashes of brilliance.</mark> <mark>It might not happen all the time, but the act itself is welcomed and not altogether disturbing when it occurs.</mark> What about when Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to display an act of novelty? Any such instance is bound to get our attention; questions arise right away. How did the AI come up with the apparent out-of-the-blue insight or novel indication? Was it a mistake, or did it fit within the parameters of what the AI was expected to produce? There is also the immediate consideration of whether the AI somehow is slipping toward the precipice of becoming sentient. Please be aware that no AI system in existence is anywhere close to reaching sentience, despite the claims and falsehoods tossed around in the media. <mark>As such, if today’s AI seems to do something that appears to be a novel act, you should not leap to the conclusion that this is a sign of human insight within technology or the emergence of human ingenuity among AI.</mark> That’s an anthropomorphic bridge too far. The reality is that any such AI “insightful” novelties are based on various concrete computational algorithms and tangible data-based pattern matching. <mark>In today’s column, we’ll be taking a close look at an example of an AI-powered novel act, illustrated via the game of Go, and relate these facets to the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars as a means of understanding the AI-versus-human related ramifications.</mark> <mark>Realize that the capacity to spot or suggest a novelty is being done methodically by an AI system, while, in contrast, no one can say for sure how humans can devise novel thoughts or intuitions.</mark> Perhaps we too are bound by some internal mechanistic-like facets, or maybe there is something else going on. Someday, hopefully, we will crack open the secret inner workings of the mind and finally know how we think. I suppose it might undercut the mystery and magical aura that oftentimes goes along with those of us that have moments of outside-the-box visions, though I’d trade that enigma to know how the cups-and-balls trickery truly functions (going behind the curtain, as it were). <mark>Speaking of novelty, a famous game match involving the playing of Go can provide useful illumination on this overall topic.</mark> Go is a popular board game in the same complexity category as chess. <mark>Arguments are made about which is tougher, chess or Go, but I’m not going to get mired into that morass.</mark> For the sake of civil discussion, the key point is that Go is highly complex and requires intense mental concentration especially at the tournament level. Generally, Go consists of trying to capture territory on a standard Go board, consisting of a 19 by 19 grid of intersecting lines. <mark>For those of you that have never tried playing Go, the closest similar kind of game might be the connect-the-dots that you played in childhood, which involves grabbing up territory, though Go is magnitudes more involved.</mark> <mark>There is no need for you to know anything in particular about Go to get the gist of what will be discussed next regarding the act of human novelty and the act of AI novelty.</mark> <mark>A famous Go competition took place about four years ago that pitted one of the world’s top professional Go players, Lee Sedol, against an AI program that had been crafted to play Go, coined as AlphaGo.</mark> There is a riveting documentary about the contest and plenty of write-ups and online videos that have in detail covered the match, including post-game analysis. Put yourself back in time to 2016 and relive what happened. <mark>Most AI developers did not anticipate that the AI of that time would be proficient enough to beat a top Go player.</mark> <mark>Sure, AI had already been able to best some top chess players, and thus offered a glimmer of expectation that Go would eventually be equally undertaken, but there weren’t any Go programs that had been able to compete at the pinnacle levels of human Go players.</mark> Most expected that it would probably be around the year 2020 or so before the capabilities of AI would be sufficient to compete in world-class Go tournaments. <mark>DeepMind Created AlphaGo Using Deep Learning, Machine Learning   \n",
              "A small-sized tech company named DeepMind Technologies devised the AlphaGo AI playing system (the firm was later acquired by Google).</mark> <mark>Using techniques from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the AlphaGo program was being revamped and adjusted right up to the actual tournament, a typical kind of last-ditch developer contortions that many of us have done when trying to get the last bit of added edge into something that is about to be demonstrated.</mark> This was a monumental competition that had garnered global interest. <mark>Human players of Go were doubtful that the AlphaGo program would win.</mark> <mark>Many AI techies were doubtful that AlphaGo would win.</mark> <mark>Even the AlphaGo developers were unsure of how well the program would do, including the stay-awake-at-night fears that the AlphaGo program would hit a bug or go into a kind of delusional mode and make outright mistakes and play foolishly.</mark> A million dollars in prize money was put into the pot for the competition. <mark>There would be five Go games played, one per day, along with associated rules about taking breaks, etc.</mark> <mark>Some predicted that Sedol would handily win all five games, doing so without cracking a sweat.</mark> <mark>AI pundits were clinging to the hope that AlphaGo would win at least one of the five games, and otherwise, present itself as a respectable level of Go player throughout the contest.</mark> In the first match, AlphaGo won. This was pretty much a worldwide shocker. <mark>Sedol was taken aback.</mark> <mark>Lots of Go players were surprised that a computer program could compete and beat someone at Sedol’s level of play.</mark> Everyone began to give some street cred to the AlphaGo program and the efforts by the AI developers. Tension grew for the next match. For the second game, it was anticipated that Sedol might significantly change his approach to the contest. Perhaps he had been overconfident coming into the competition, some harshly asserted, and the loss of the first game would awaken him to the importance of putting all his concentration into the tournament. Or, possibly he had played as though he was competing with a lesser capable player and thus was not pulling out all the stops to try and win the match. What happened in the second game? <mark>Turns out that AlphaGo prevailed, again, and also did something that was seemingly remarkable for those that avidly play Go.</mark> <mark>On the 37th move of the match, the AlphaGo program opted to make placement onto the Go board in a spot that nobody especially anticipated.</mark> It was a surprise move, coming partway through a match that otherwise was relatively conventional in the nature of the moves being made by both Sedol and AlphaGo. <mark>At the time, in real-time, rampant speculation was that the move was an utter gaffe on the part of the AlphaGo program.</mark> Instead, it became famous as a novel move, known now as “Move 37” and heralded in Go and used colloquially overall to suggest any instance when AI does something of a novel or unexpected manner. In the third match, AlphaGo won again, now having successfully beaten Sedol in a 3-out-of-5 winner competition. <mark>They continued though to play a fourth and a fifth game.</mark> During the fourth game, things were tight as usual and the match play was going head-to-head (well, head versus AI). Put yourself into the shoes of Sedol. <mark>In one sense, he wasn’t just a Go player, he was somehow representing all of humanity (an unfair and misguided viewpoint, but pervasive anyway), and the pressure was on him to win at least one game.</mark> <mark>Just even one game would be something to hang your hat on, and bolster faith in mankind (again, a nonsensical way to look at it).</mark> <mark>At the seventy-eighth move of the fourth game, Sedol made a so-called “wedge” play that was not conventional and surprised onlookers.</mark> <mark>The next move by AlphaGo was rotten and diminished the likelihood of a win by the AI system.</mark> <mark>After additional play, ultimately AlphaGo tossed in the towel and resigned from the match, thus Sedol finally had a win against the AI in his belt.</mark> <mark>He ended-up losing the fifth game, so AlphaGo won four games, Sedol won one).</mark> His move also became famous, generally known as “Move 78” in the lore of Go playing. <mark>Something else that is worthwhile to know about involves the overarching strategy that AlphaGo was crafted to utilize.</mark> <mark>When you play a game, let’s say connect-the-dots, you can aim to grab as many squares at each moment of play, doing so under the belief that inevitably you will then win by the accumulation of those tactically-oriented successes.</mark> <mark>Human players of Go are often apt to play that way, as it can be said too of chess players, and nearly any kind of game playing altogether.</mark> <mark>Another approach involves playing to win, even if only by the thinnest of margins, as long as you win.</mark> In that case, you might not be motivated for each tactical move to gain near-term territory or score immediate points, and be willing instead to play a larger scope game per se. The proverbial mantra is that if you are shortsighted, you might win some of the battles, but could eventually lose the war. Therefore, it might be a better strategy to keep your eye on the prize, winning the war, albeit if it means that there are battles and skirmishes to be lost along the way. <mark>The AI developers devised AlphaGo with that kind of macro-perspective underlying how the AI system functioned.</mark> Humans can have an especially hard time choosing at the moment to make a move that might look bad or ill-advised, such as giving up territory, finding themselves to be unable to grit their teeth, and taking a lump or two during play. <mark>The embarrassment at the instant is difficult to offset by betting that it is going to ultimately be okay, and you will prevail in the end.</mark> <mark>For an AI system, there is no semblance of that kind of sentiment involved, and it is all about calculated odds and probabilities.</mark> <mark>Now that we’ve covered the legendary Go match, let’s consider some lessons learned about novelty.</mark> <mark>The “Move 38” made by the AI system was not magical.</mark> It was an interesting move, for sure, and the AI developers later indicated that the move was one that the AI had calculated would rarely be undertaken by a human player. <mark>This can be interpreted in two ways (at least).</mark> One interpretation is that a human player would not make that move because humans are right and know that it would be a lousy move. Another interpretation is that humans would not make that move due to a belief that the move is unwise, but this could be a result of the humans insufficiently assessing the ultimate value of the move, in the long-run, and getting caught up in a shorter time frame semblance of play. <mark>In this instance, it turned out to be a good move—maybe a brilliant move—and turned the course of the game to the advantage of the AI.</mark> Thus, what looked like brilliance was in fact a calculated move that few humans would have imagined as valuable and for which jostled humans to rethink how they think about such matters. Some useful recap lessons:   \n",
              "Showcasing Human Self-Limited Insight. When the AI does something seemingly novel, it might be viewed as novel simply because humans have already predetermined what is customary and anything beyond that is blunted by the assumption that it is unworthy or mistaken. You could say that we are mentally trapped by our own drawing of the lines of what is considered as inside versus outside the box. <mark>Humans Exploiting AI For Added Insight.</mark> Humans can gainfully assess an AI-powered novelty to potentially re-calibrate human thinking on a given topic, enlarging our understanding via leveraging something that the AI, via its vast calculative capacity, might detect or spot that we have not yet so ascertained. Thus, besides admiring the novelty, we ought to seek to improve our mental prowess by whatever source shines brightly including an AI system. <mark>AI Novelty Is A Dual-Edged Sword.</mark> We need to be mindful of all AI systems and their possibility of acting in a novel way, which could be good or could be bad. In the Go game, it worked out well. <mark>In other circumstances, the AI exploiting the novelty route might go off the tracks, as it were.</mark> <mark>Let’s see how this can be made tangible via exploring the advent of AI-based true self-driving cars.</mark> <mark>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/   \n",

              "Self-Driving Cars And Acts Of Novelty   \n",
              "For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. <mark>All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.</mark> <mark>You could say that the AI is playing a game, a driving game, requiring tactical decision-making and strategic planning, akin to when playing Go or chess, though in this case involving life-or-death matters driving a multi-ton car on our public roadways.</mark> Our base assumption is that the AI driving system is going to always take a tried-and-true approach to any driving decisions. This assumption is somewhat shaped around a notion that AI is a type of robot or automata that is bereft of any human biases or human foibles. <mark>In reality, there is no reason to make this kind of assumption.</mark> <mark>Yes, we can generally rule out the aspect that the AI is not going to display the emotion of a human ilk, and we also know that the AI will not be drunk or DUI in its driving efforts.</mark> <mark>Nonetheless, if the AI has been trained using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), it can pick up subtleties of human behavioral patterns in the data about human driving, out of which it will likewise utilize or mimic in choosing its driving actions (for example, see my column postings involving an analysis of potential racial biases in AI and the possibility of gender biases).</mark> <mark>Turning back to the topic of novelty, let’s ponder a specific use case.</mark> <mark>A few years ago, I was driving on an open highway, going at the prevailing speed of around 65 miles per hour, and something nearly unimaginable occurred.</mark> A car coming toward me in the opposing lane, and likely traveling at around 60 to 70 miles per hour, suddenly and unexpectedly veered into my lane. <mark>It was one of those moments that you cannot anticipate.</mark> <mark>There did not appear to be any reason for the other driver to be headed toward me, in my lane of traffic, and coming at me for an imminent and bone-chillingly terrifying head-on collision.</mark> If there had been debris on the other lane, it might have been a clue that perhaps this other driver was simply trying to swing around the obstruction. No debris. If there was a slower moving car, the driver might have wanted to do a fast end-around to get past it. Nope, there was absolutely no discernible basis for this radical and life-threatening maneuver. What would you do? Come on, hurry, the clock is ticking, and you have just a handful of split seconds to make a life-or-death driving decision. You could stay in your lane and hope that the other driver realizes the error of their ways, opting to veer back into their lane at the last moment. Or, you could proactively go into the opposing lane, giving the other driver a clear path in your lane, but this could be a chancy game of chicken whereby the other driver chooses to go back into their lane (plus, there was other traffic further behind that driver, so going into the opposing lane was quite dicey). Okay, so do you stay in your lane or veer away into the opposing lane? I dare say that most people would be torn between those two options. <mark>Neither one is palatable.</mark> Suppose the AI of a self-driving car was faced with the same circumstance. <mark>What would the AI do?</mark> <mark>The odds are that even if the AI had been fed with thousands upon thousands of miles of driving via a database about human driving while undergoing the ML/DL training, there might not be any instances of a head-to-head nature and thus no prior pattern to utilize for making this onerous decision.</mark> <mark>Anyway, here’s a twist.</mark> <mark>Imagine that the AI calculated the probabilities involving which way to go, and in some computational manner came to the conclusion that the self-driving car should go into the ditch that was at the right of the roadway.</mark> This was intended to avoid entirely a collision with the other car (the AI estimated that a head-on collision would be near-certain death for the occupants). The AI estimated that going into the ditch at such high speed would indisputably wreck the car and cause great bodily injury to the occupants, but the odds of assured death were (let’s say) calculated as lower than the head-on option possibilities (this is a variant of the infamous Trolley Problem, as covered in my columns). <mark>I’m betting that you would concede that most humans would be relatively unwilling to aim purposely into that ditch, which they know for sure is going to be a wreck and potential death, while instead willing (reluctantly) to take a hoped-for chance of either veering into the other lane or staying on course and wishing for the best.</mark> In some sense, the AI might seem to have made a novel choice. It is one that (we’ll assume) few humans would have given any explicit thought toward. <mark>Returning to the earlier recap of the points about AI novelty, you could suggest that in this example, the AI has exceeded a human self-imposed limitation by the AI having considered otherwise “unthinkable” options.</mark> From this, perhaps we can learn to broaden our view for options that otherwise don’t seem apparent. <mark>The other recap element was that the AI novelty can be a dual-edged sword.</mark> <mark>If the AI did react by driving into the ditch, and you were inside the self-driving car, and you got badly injured, would you later believe that the AI acted in a novel manner or that it acted mistakenly or adversely?</mark> <mark>Some might say that if you lived to ask that question, apparently the AI made the right choice.</mark> <mark>The counter-argument is that if the AI had gone with one of the other choices, perhaps you would have sailed right past the other car and not gotten a single scratch.</mark> <mark>For more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here: https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/ \n",

Overall, AI that appears to engage in novel approaches to problems can be advantageous and in some circumstances such as playing a board game can be right or wrong, for which being wrong does not especially put human lives at stake. For AI-based true self-driving cars, lives are at stake. We’ll need to proceed mindfully and with our eyes wide open about how we want AI driving systems to operate, including calculating odds and deriving choices while at the wheel of the vehicle.

              "Engineers tend to see things in unambiguous terms, which some may call Black and White terms, such as a choice between right or wrong and good and bad.</mark> <mark>The consideration of ethics in AI is highly nuanced, with vast gray areas, making it  challenging for AI software engineers to apply it in their work.</mark> <mark>That was a takeaway from a session on the Future of Standards and Ethical AI at the AI World Government conference held in-person and virtually in Alexandria, Va. this week.</mark> <mark>An overall impression from the conference is that the discussion of AI and ethics is happening in virtually every quarter of AI in the vast enterprise of the federal government, and the consistency of points being made across all these different and independent efforts stood out.</mark> <mark>Beth-Ann Schuelke-Leech, associate professor, engineering management, University of Windsor\n",
              "“We engineers often think of ethics as a fuzzy thing that no one has really explained,” stated Beth-Anne Schuelke-Leech, an associate professor, Engineering Management and Entrepreneurship at the University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, speaking at the Future of Ethical AI session.</mark> “It can be difficult for engineers looking for solid constraints to be told to be ethical. <mark>That becomes really complicated because we don’t know what it really means.”  \n",
              "Schuelke-Leech started her career as an engineer, then decided to pursue a PhD in public policy, a background which enables her to see things as an engineer and as a social scientist.</mark> <mark>“I got a PhD in social science, and have been pulled back into the engineering world where I am involved in AI projects, but based in a mechanical engineering faculty,” she said.</mark> An engineering project has a goal, which describes the purpose, a set of needed features and functions, and a set of constraints, such as budget and timeline “The standards and regulations become part of the constraints,” she said. “If I know I have to comply with it, I will do that. <mark>But if you tell me it’s a good thing to do, I may or may not adopt that.”  \n",
              "Schuelke-Leech also serves as chair of the IEEE Society’s Committee on the Social Implications of Technology Standards.</mark> <mark>She commented, “Voluntary compliance standards such as from the IEEE are essential from people in the industry getting together to say this is what we think we should do as an industry.”  \n",
              "Some standards, such as around interoperability, do not have the force of law but engineers comply with them, so their systems will work.</mark> Other standards are described as good practices, but are not required to be followed. “Whether it helps me to achieve my goal or hinders me getting to the objective, is how the engineer looks at it,” she said. <mark>The Pursuit of AI Ethics Described as “Messy and Difficult”  \n",
              "Sara Jordan, senior counsel, Future of Privacy Forum\n",
              "Sara Jordan, senior counsel with the Future of Privacy Forum, in the session with Schuelke-Leech, works on the ethical challenges of AI and machine learning and is an active member of the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics and Autonomous and Intelligent Systems.</mark> “Ethics is messy and difficult, and is context-laden. <mark>We have a proliferation of theories, frameworks and constructs,” she said, adding, “The practice of ethical AI will require repeatable, rigorous thinking in context.”  \n",
              "Schuelke-Leech offered, “Ethics is not an end outcome.</mark> It is the process being followed. <mark>But I’m also looking for someone to tell me what I need to do to do my job, to tell me how to be ethical, what rules I’m supposed to follow, to take away the ambiguity.”  \n",
              "“Engineers shut down when you get into funny words that they don’t understand, like ‘ontological,’ They’ve been taking math and science since they were 13-years-old,” she said.</mark> <mark>She has found it difficult to get engineers involved in attempts to draft standards for ethical AI.</mark> “Engineers are missing from the table,” she said. “The debates about whether we can get to 100% ethical are conversations engineers do not have.”  \n",
              "She concluded, “If their managers tell them to figure it out, they will do so. We need to help the engineers cross the bridge halfway. <mark>It is essential that social scientists and engineers don’t give up on this.”  \n",
              "Leader’s Panel Described Integration of Ethics into AI Development Practices  \n",
              "The topic of ethics in AI is coming up more in the curriculum of the US Naval War College of Newport, R.I., which was established to provide advanced study for US Navy officers and now educates leaders from all services.</mark> <mark>Ross Coffey, a military professor of National Security Affairs at the institution, participated in a Leader’s Panel on AI, Ethics and Smart Policy at AI World Government.</mark> <mark>“The ethical literacy of students increases over time as they are working with these ethical issues, which is why it is an urgent matter because it will take a long time,” Coffey said.</mark> <mark>Panel member Carole Smith, a senior research scientist with Carnegie Mellon University who studies human-machine interaction, has been involved in integrating ethics into AI systems development since 2015.</mark> She cited the importance of “demystifying” AI. “My interest is in understanding what kind of interactions we can create where the human is appropriately trusting the system they are working with, not over- or under-trusting it,” she said, adding, “In general, people have higher expectations than they should for the systems.”  \n",
              "As an example, she cited the Tesla Autopilot features, which implement self-driving car capability to a degree but not completely. “People assume the system can do a much broader set of activities than it was designed to do. Helping people understand the limitations of a system is important. Everyone needs to understand the expected outcomes of a system and what some of the mitigating circumstances might be,” she said. Panel member Taka Ariga, the first chief data scientist appointed to the US Government Accountability Office and director of the GAO’s Innovation Lab, sees a gap in AI literacy for the young workforce coming into the federal government. “Data scientist training does not always include ethics. Accountable AI is a laudable construct, but I’m not sure everyone buys into it. We need their responsibility to go beyond technical aspects and be accountable to the end user we are trying to serve,” he said. Panel moderator Alison Brooks, PhD, research VP of Smart Cities and Communities at the IDC market research firm, asked whether principles of ethical AI can be shared across the boundaries of nations. <mark>“We will have a limited ability for every nation to align on the same exact approach, but we will have to align in some ways on what we will not allow AI to do, and what people will also be responsible for,” stated Smith of CMU.</mark> The panelists credited the European Commission for being out front on these issues of ethics, especially in the enforcement realm. <mark>Ross of the Naval War Colleges acknowledged the importance of finding common ground around AI ethics.</mark> “From a military perspective, our interoperability needs to go to a whole new level. <mark>We need to find common ground with our partners and our allies on what we will allow AI to do and what we will not allow AI to do.” Unfortunately, “I don’t know if that discussion is happening,” he said.</mark> <mark>Discussion on AI ethics could perhaps be pursued as part of certain existing treaties, Smith suggested  \n",
              "The many AI ethics principles, frameworks, and road maps being offered in many federal agencies can be challenging to follow and be made consistent.</mark> <mark>Take said, “I am hopeful that over the next year or two, we will see a coalescing.”  \n",

              "Dorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer, National Science Foundation\n",
              "“People feel that AI is within their grasp because the technology is available, but the technology is ahead of our cultural maturity,” said panel member Dorothy Aronson, CIO and Chief Data Officer for the National Science Foundation.</mark> “It’s like giving a sharp object to a child. <mark>We might have access to big data, but it might not be the right thing to do,” to work with it in all cases.</mark> Things are accelerating, which is raising expectations. When panel member Vivek Rao, lecturer and researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, was working on his PhD, a paper on natural language processing might be a master’s thesis. “Now we assign it as a homework assignment with a two-day turnaround. <mark>We have an enormous amount of compute power that was not available even two years ago,” he said of his students, who he described as “digital natives” with high expectations of what AI makes possible.</mark> <mark>Rachel Dzombak, digital transformation lead, Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University\n",
              "Panel moderator Rachel Dzombak, digital transformation lead at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, asked the panelists what is unique about working on AI in the government.</mark> <mark>Aronson said the government cannot get too far ahead with the technology, or the users will not know how to interact with it.</mark> “We’re not building iPhones,” she said. <mark>“We have experimentation going on, and we are always looking ahead, anticipating the future, so we can make the most cost-effective decisions.</mark> <mark>In the government right now, we are seeing the convergence of the emerging generation and the close-to-retiring generation, who we also have to serve.”   \n",
              "Early in her career, Aronson did not want to work in the government.</mark> “I thought it meant you were either in the armed services or the Peace Corps,” she said. “But what I learned after a while is what motivates federal employees is service to larger, problem-solving institutions. We are trying to solve really big problems of equity and diversity, and getting food to people and keeping people safe. People that work for the government are dedicated to those missions.”   \n",
              "She referred to her two children in their 20s, who like the idea of service, but in “tiny chunks,” meaning, “They don’t look at the government as a place where they have freedom, and they can do whatever they want. <mark>They see it as a lockdown situation.</mark> <mark>But it’s really not.”   \n",
              "Berkeley Students Learn About Role of Government in Disaster Response  \n",
              "Rao of Berkeley said his students are seeing wildfires in California and asking who is working on the challenge of doing something about them.</mark> When he tells them it is almost always local, state and federal government entities, “Students are generally surprised to find that out.”   \n",
              "In one example, he developed a course on innovation in disaster response, in collaboration with CMU and the Department of Defense, the Army Futures Lab and Coast Guard search and rescue. <mark>“This was eye-opening for students,” he said.</mark> At the outset, two of 35 students expressed interest in a federal government career. By the end of the course, 10 of the 35 students were expressing interest. <mark>One of them was hired by the Naval Surface Warfare Center outside Corona, Calif. as a software engineer, Rao said.</mark> Aronson described the process of bringing on new federal employees as a “heavy lift,” suggesting, “if we could prepare in advance, it would move a lot faster.” \n",
              "Bryan Lane, director of Data & AI, General Services Administration\n",
              "Asked by Dzombak what skill sets and mindsets are seen as essential to AI engineering teams, panel member Bryan Lane, director of Data & AI at the General Services Administration (who announced during the session that he is taking on a new role at FDIC), said resiliency is a necessary quality. Lane is a technology executive within the GSA IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoE) with over 15 years of experience leading advanced analytics and technology initiatives. <mark>He has led the GSA partnership with the DoD Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).</mark> [Ed. <mark>Note: Known as “the Jake.”] Lane also is the founder of DATA XD.</mark> <mark>He also has experience in industry, managing acquisition portfolios.</mark> <mark>“The most important thing about resilient teams going on an AI journey is that you need to be ready for the unexpected, and the mission persists,” he said.</mark> “If you are all aligned on the importance of the mission, the team can be held together.”  \n",
              "Good Sign that Team Members Acknowledge Having “Never Done This Before”  \n",
              "Regarding mindset, he said more of his team members are coming to him and saying, “I’ve never done this before.” He sees that as a good sign that offers an opportunity to talk about risk and alternative solutions. <mark>“When your team has the psychological safety to say that they don’t know something,” Lane sees it as positive.</mark> <mark>“The focus is always on what you have done and what you have delivered.</mark> <mark>Rarely is the focus on what you have not done before and what you want to grow into,” he said,  \n",
              "Aronson has found it challenging to get AI projects off the ground.</mark> “It’s hard to tell management that you have a use case or problem to solve and want to go at it, and there is a 50-50 chance it will get done, and you don’t know how much it’s going to cost,” she said. “It comes down to articulating the rationale and convincing others it’s the right thing to do to move forward.”  \n",
              "Rao said he talks to students about experimentation and having an experimental mindset. “AI tools can be easily accessible, but they can mask the challenges you can encounter. When you apply the vision API, for example in the context of challenges in your business or government agency, things may not be smooth,” he said. <mark>Moderator Dzombak asked the panelists how they build teams.</mark> Arson said, “You need a mix of people.” She has tried “communities of practice” around solving specific problems, where people can come and go. “You bring people together around a problem and not a tool,” she said. Lane seconded this. “I really have stopped focusing on tools in general,” he said. <mark>He ran experiments at JAIC in accounting, finance and other areas.</mark> <mark>“We found it’s not really about the tools.</mark> <mark>It’s about getting the right people together to understand the problems, then looking at the tools available,” he said.</mark> <mark>Lane said he sets up “cross-functional teams” that are “a little more formal than a community of interest.” He has found them to be effective for working together on a problem for maybe 45 days.</mark> <mark>He also likes working with customers of the needed services inside the organization, and has seen customers learn about data management and AI as a result.</mark> “We will pick up one or two along the way who become advocates for accelerating AI throughout the organization,” Lane said. Lane sees it taking five years to work out proven methods of thinking, working, and best practices for developing AI systems to serve the government. <mark>He mentioned The Opportunity Project (TOP) of the US Census Bureau, begun in 2016 to work on challenges such as ocean plastic pollution, COVID-19 economic recovery and disaster response.</mark> <mark>TOP has engaged in over 135 public-facing projects in that time, and has over 1,300 alumni including developers, designers, community leaders, data and policy experts, students and government agencies.</mark> “It’s based on a way of thinking and how to organize work,” Lane said. “We have to scale the model of delivery, but five years from now, we will have enough proof of concept to know what works and what does not.” \n",

              "“We landed on a lifecycle approach,” which steps through stages of design, development, deployment and continuous monitoring.</mark> <mark>The development effort stands on four “pillars” of Governance, Data, Monitoring and Performance.</mark> Governance reviews what the organization has put in place to oversee the AI efforts. <mark>“The chief AI officer might be in place, but what does it mean?</mark> Can the person make changes? <mark>Is it multidisciplinary?”  At a system level within this pillar, the team will review individual AI models to see if they were “purposely deliberated.”  \n",
              "For the Data pillar, his team will examine how the training data was evaluated, how representative it is, and is it functioning as intended.</mark> <mark>For the Performance pillar, the team will consider the “societal impact” the AI system will have in deployment, including whether it risks a violation of the Civil Rights Act.</mark> “Auditors have a long-standing track record of evaluating equity. We grounded the evaluation of AI to a proven system,” Ariga said. <mark>Emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring, he said, “AI is not a technology you deploy and forget.” he said.</mark> “We are preparing to continually monitor for model drift and the fragility of algorithms, and we are scaling the AI appropriately.” The evaluations will determine whether the AI system continues to meet the need “or whether a sunset is more appropriate,” Ariga said. He is part of the discussion with NIST on an overall government AI accountability framework. <mark>“We don’t want an ecosystem of confusion,” Ariga said.</mark> “We want a whole-government approach. <mark>We feel that this is a useful first step in pushing high-level ideas down to an altitude meaningful to the practitioners of AI.”  \n",
              "DIU Assesses Whether Proposed Projects Meet Ethical AI Guidelines  \n",
              "Bryce Goodman, chief strategist for AI and machine learning, the Defense Innovation Unit\n",
              "At the DIU, Goodman is involved in a similar effort to develop guidelines for developers of AI projects within the government.</mark> Projects Goodman has been involved with implementation of AI for humanitarian assistance and disaster response, predictive maintenance, to counter-disinformation, and predictive health. He heads the Responsible AI Working Group. He is a faculty member of Singularity University, has a wide range of consulting clients from inside and outside the government, and holds a PhD in AI and Philosophy from the University of Oxford. <mark>The DOD in February 2020 adopted five areas of Ethical Principles for AI after 15 months of consulting with AI experts in commercial industry, government academia and the American public.</mark> These areas are: Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable and Governable. <mark>“Those are well-conceived, but it’s not obvious to an engineer how to translate them into a specific project requirement,” Good said in a presentation on Responsible AI Guidelines at the AI World Government event.</mark> <mark>“That’s the gap we are trying to fill.” \n",
              "Before the DIU even considers a project, they run through the ethical principles to see if it passes muster.</mark> Not all projects do. “There needs to be an option to say the technology is not there or the problem is not compatible with AI,” he said. <mark>All project stakeholders, including from commercial vendors and within the government, need to be able to test and validate and go beyond minimum legal requirements to meet the principles.</mark> “The law is not moving as fast as AI, which is why these principles are important,” he said. <mark>Also, collaboration is going on across the government to ensure values are being preserved and maintained.</mark> “Our intention with these guidelines is not to try to achieve perfection, but to avoid catastrophic consequences,” Goodman said. <mark>“It can be difficult to get a group to agree on what the best outcome is, but it’s easier to get the group to agree on what the worst-case outcome is.”  \n",
              "The DIU guidelines along with case studies and supplemental materials will be published on the DIU website “soon,” Goodman said, to help others leverage the experience.</mark> <mark>Here are Questions DIU Asks Before Development Starts  \n",
              "The first step in the guidelines is to define the task.</mark> <mark>“That’s the single most important question,” he said.</mark> <mark>“Only if there is an advantage, should you use AI.” \n",
              "Next is a benchmark, which needs to be set up front to know if the project has delivered.</mark> Next, he evaluates ownership of the candidate data. <mark>“Data is critical to the AI system and is the place where a lot of problems can exist.” Goodman said.</mark> “We need a certain contract on who owns the data. <mark>If ambiguous, this can lead to problems.”  \n",
              "Next, Goodman’s team wants a sample of data to evaluate.</mark> Then, they need to know how and why the information was collected. “If consent was given for one purpose, we cannot use it for another purpose without re-obtaining consent,” he said. <mark>Next, the team asks if the responsible stakeholders are identified, such as pilots who could be affected if a component fails.</mark> Next, the responsible mission-holders must be identified. <mark>“We need a single individual for this,” Goodman said.</mark> “Often we have a tradeoff between the performance of an algorithm and its explainability. We might have to decide between the two. Those kinds of decisions have an ethical component and an operational component. <mark>So we need to have someone who is accountable for those decisions, which is consistent with the chain of command in the DOD.”   \n",
              "Finally, the DIU team requires a process for rolling back if things go wrong.</mark> “We need to be cautious about abandoning the previous system,” he said. Once all these questions are answered in a satisfactory way, the team moves on to the development phase. In lessons learned, Goodman said, “Metrics are key. And simply measuring accuracy might not be adequate. <mark>We need to be able to measure success.” \n",
              "Also, fit the technology to the task.</mark> “High risk applications require low-risk technology. <mark>And when potential harm is significant, we need to have high confidence in the technology,” he said.</mark> Another lesson learned is to set expectations with commercial vendors. <mark>“We need vendors to be transparent,” he said.</mark> ”When someone says they have a proprietary algorithm they cannot tell us about, we are very wary. We view the relationship as a collaboration. <mark>It’s the only way we can ensure that the AI is developed responsibly.”  \n",
              "Lastly, “AI is not magic.</mark> <mark>It will not solve everything.</mark> It should only be used when necessary and only when we can prove it will provide an advantage.”  \n",

              "One company in the throes of this new growth, AssemblyAI of San Francisco, is offering an API for speech recognition capable of transcribing videos, podcasts, phone calls, and remote meetings.</mark> <mark>The company was founded by CEO Dylan Fox in 2017 and has received backing from Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, as well as NVIDIA.</mark> <mark>Fox has an unusual background for a high tech entrepreneur.</mark> <mark>He is a graduate of George Washington University with a degree in business administration, business economics, and public policy.</mark> <mark>He got a job as a software engineer for machine learning in the emerging product lab of Cisco in San Francisco, working on deep neural networks and machine learning.</mark> He got the idea for AssemblyAi and attracted capital from Y Combinator, which enabled him to hire data scientists and data engineers to get the technology off the ground. <mark>Asked in an interview with AI Trends how he made this transition from undergrad in business administration and economics to high-tech entrepreneur, Fox said, “I taught myself how to program, which led me to a path of machine learning.</mark> <mark>I was looking for a harder software challenge, which led to natural language processing, which took me to Cisco.” They were working on Siri for the Enterprise for Apple at the time, \n",
              "To speed up the work, Cisco was looking to acquire speech recognition software; Fox was in the catbird’s seat for the search.</mark> “We looked at Nuance,” for example, acknowledged as a market leader and owner of more speech recognition software than its competitors. (The acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft for $19.6 billion is expected to be finalized by year-end.) The young, budding entrepreneur was not impressed. “It was crazy how bad all the options were from an accuracy and a developer point of view,” he stated. <mark>He was impressed by Twilio, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2008, which that year released the Twilio Voice API to make and receive phone calls hosted in the cloud.</mark> The company has since raised $103 million in venture capital. <mark>“They were setting new standards for a good API for developers,” Fox said.</mark> <mark>Fox’s idea was to use AI and machine learning to achieve “super accurate results, and make it easy for developers to incorporate the API into their products.</mark> One customer is CallRail, offering call tracking and marketing analytics software, which plans to incorporate AssembyAI’s API to gain insight into why people are calling. Other customers include NBC and the Wall Street Journal, using the product to transcribe content and interviews, and provide closed captioning. “We’ve been working on building as close to human speech recognition quality as possible. <mark>It’s been a lot of work” Fox said.</mark> He expects to reach that plateau in 2022. He targets companies incorporating speech recognition into their products and makes it easy to buy. Customers pay on a usage basis; for every second of audio transcribed, AssemblyAI charges a fraction of a penny. Clients get billed monthly. If a customer uses 10 hours a month, it costs about nine dollars. <mark>If a customer uses a million hours a month, it costs about $900,000.</mark> Voice recognition is a hot market. <mark>“Many new startups are being launched,” Fox said, providing opportunity.</mark> <mark>“Many interesting new businesses are being built on voice data.”   \n",

              "Are there things that we must not know?</mark> This is an age-old question. <mark>Some assert that there is the potential for knowledge that ought to not be known.</mark> <mark>In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall.</mark> <mark>The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking could be unduly dangerous.</mark> <mark>It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.</mark> <mark>The typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are overwhelming.</mark> <mark>The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.</mark> <mark>It is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it has no good possibilities at all.</mark> <mark>Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the knowledge has no counterbalancing effects.</mark> It is just plain bad. <mark>We are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed.</mark> This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it outweighs the good. <mark>On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good, which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest or become realized as such).</mark> <mark>The most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.</mark> A contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden knowledge consists of the atomic bomb. <mark>Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt exemplar of the problems associated with knowledge.</mark> <mark>Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been achieved, there presumably would not be any such device.</mark> <mark>In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.</mark> <mark>One perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden category.</mark> This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle. <mark>You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden, but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been already uncovered or rendered.</mark> Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone. On a related twist, suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be averted because it is predetermined as forbidden. Some people might accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box. Meanwhile, there might be others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated forbidden knowledge, do so anyway. <mark>This then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge, namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there first.</mark> In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch. Round and round we can go. The main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power. The alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge. <mark>Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save humanity from other ills.</mark> <mark>Maybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful.</mark> <mark>Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent.</mark> Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a different light. There is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge. Some philosophers suggest you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge. If that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge. There is a relatively new venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here’s the rub. <mark>Suppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge about how humans can think.</mark> There are two major potential gotchas. <mark>First, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they also might end up doing bad things.</mark> <mark>If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by allowing AI to be put into use.</mark> <mark>Secondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not discover or reveal those mental mechanisms.</mark> It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step B. <mark>We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not arise.</mark> In any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI. Plenty of efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of, building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical aspects of their efforts. AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory biases and other problems. All told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and then exploitation of forbidden knowledge. Be aware that many would scoff at this allegation. There are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes potential forbidden knowledge. The technology and technological elements are relatively ho-hum, they would argue. You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the ballpark of forbidden knowledge. <mark>For those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that path.</mark> Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at the next turn. One area where AI is being actively used is to create Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually seeing the emergence of self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships, self-driving submersibles, etc. <mark>Today’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent of AI-based, true self-driving cars.</mark> <mark>Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system.</mark> There isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision for a human to drive the vehicle. <mark>Here’s an intriguing question that has arisen: Might the crafting of AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?</mark> Before jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when referring to true self-driving cars. <mark>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/   \n",

              "As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</mark> <mark>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3.</mark> The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). <mark>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</mark> <mark>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</mark> <mark>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</mark> <mark>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</mark> You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. <mark>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/   \n",

              "For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</mark> All occupants will be passengers. <mark>The AI is doing the driving.</mark> One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can. Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient? Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet. With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about the facets of driving. Driving and all that it entails will need to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car. <mark>Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic.</mark> The crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving cars. <mark>We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.</mark> <mark>Per the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit of self-driving cars.</mark> <mark>Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about what forbidden knowledge might entail.</mark> One could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it. That is a rabbit hole that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that presumption at hand if so desired. <mark>That covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the future.</mark> <mark>Generally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4 and attain Level 5.</mark> To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the existing approaches. Not everyone would agree with that assumption. <mark>Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4.</mark> Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly preclude us from being able to attain Level 5. <mark>There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end or blind alley.</mark> An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they would vehemently argue. <mark>There is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of dead-end.</mark> <mark>In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level 4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5.</mark> Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5 realm. <mark>Aha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that the forbidden knowledge question can reside.</mark> In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge. To some, this seems farfetched. They would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge are you even talking about? <mark>Here’s their logic.</mark> <mark>Humans are able to drive cars.</mark> <mark>Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates to the act of driving a car.</mark> Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden knowledge. Seems like pretty ironclad logic. <mark>The retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning.</mark> <mark>With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about the world around us.</mark> When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense reasoning. <mark>We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity, and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore when driving a car.</mark> <mark>Attempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon).</mark> Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of humans, there is no comparison. They are night and day. <mark>If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere playthings in contrast.</mark> <mark>You might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.</mark> <mark>The belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also this will hold back the Level 4 too.</mark> It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based driving and piloting systems. <mark>If you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of forbidden knowledge.</mark> <mark>On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for alarm or concern.</mark> <mark>The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily embody forbidden knowledge.</mark> <mark>The twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden knowledge.</mark> Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge formulation.

              "Wow, that’s quite a bit of pondering, contemplation, and (some would say) wild thinking. <mark>Maybe so, but it is a consideration that some would wish that we gave at least some credence toward and devoted attention to.</mark> <mark>There is the angst that we might find ourselves by happenstance stumbling into forbidden knowledge on these voracious self-driving cars quests.</mark> <mark>For however you might emphasize that having AI-based true self-driving cars will be a potential blessing, proffering mobility-for-all and leading to reducing the number of car crash-related fatalities, there is a sneaking suspicion that it will not be all-good.</mark> <mark>The catch or trap could be that there is some kind of forbidden knowledge that will get brought to the eye and we will inevitably kick ourselves that we didn’t see it coming.</mark> The next time you are munching on a delicious apple, give some thought to whether self-driving cars might be forbidden fruit. We are on the path to taking a big bite, and we’ll have to see where that takes us. Copyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot  \n",
